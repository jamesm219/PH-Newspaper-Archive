How microfragmentation can help restore coral reefs,," , / 10:02 AM July 06, 2024","Record-high sea temperatures are bleaching , worldwide and putting a new focus on attempts to restore these key marine ecosystems.,Here is an overview of how coral restoration is being done around the world:,Restoration begins with obtaining coral, sometimes by breaking it off from a healthy reef. These pieces can be broken into smaller bits in a process called microfragmentation.,Each piece can become a new coral.,Another option involves collecting “fragments of opportunity” — coral pieces broken off by natural causes such as storms.,Conservationists can also propagate from egg bundles collected during reef spawning, though this is perhaps the most difficult approach.,Spawning is brief, generally happening just once a year, and is affected by many factors, including the lunar phase and water temperature.,Coral microfragments generally go into a “nursery” until they grow sturdy enough to be transplanted to an existing reef or an artificial structure.,Fragments of opportunity are treated similarly. If big enough, they can be transplanted directly to natural or artificial reefs.,Bundles of coral eggs and sperm collected during spawning will develop into larvae that can then be settled onto reefs or, more commonly, grown on artificial foundations before being transplanted to their final homes.,Other techniques are used to bolster coral restoration, including mineral accretion technology.,This involves sending a low-voltage electrical current through seawater to encourage minerals to dissolve and crystallize on artificial reef structures, speeding up coral growth.,The technique has had mixed results, with some studies reporting better growth and more resilient corals, but others finding no significant benefits.,Other interventions include substrate stabilization, which shores up reef foundations, and algae removal.,Restoration projects heavily favor quick-growing branching corals.,The delicate branches of these corals are more susceptible to becoming fragments of opportunity, and are also easier to microfragment than massive or encrusting corals.,Their fast-growing nature gives restoration projects quicker results, though focusing on only one type of coral can reduce ecosystem diversity.,Coral restoration projects report survival rates of around 60-70 percent, according to a study published in 2020.,But around half the projects in the study failed to properly measure whether they achieved the goals stated at the outset, including reef function.,Monitoring was also often brief, at a median of just one year, far less than the time needed for a reef to form, according to the authors.,Still, the projects can produce real benefits.,A 2024 study of artificial reefs in Indonesia found that within four years the structures had a coral carbonate budget — a measure of reef wellbeing — that was nearly equal to nearby healthy natural reef.,Some experts worry that coral restoration is too often presented as panacea for reviving reefs, and point out that transplants will only survive if the surrounding conditions are right.,That means first addressing climate change, which causes the warm temperatures that lead to coral bleaching.,“Well-designed and managed restoration projects have an important role to play, but there is only so much they can do if radical action on the climate is not taken almost immediately,” warned Lisa Bostrom-Einarsson, the marine ecologist who led the 2020 study.,And other stressors, from blast fishing to sedimentation, must also be tackled for reefs to have a future.,Reef restoration also rarely offers a one-for-one replacement of destroyed ecosystems.,The Indonesia reefs examined in the 2024 study are still largely made up of transplanted corals, with little sign yet that “natural recruits” are taking root and building reef diversity.,Building reefs through microfragmentation also limits genetic diversity and can put reefs at risk if disease takes hold.,Still, well-done restoration offers considerable benefits, including coastal protection and boosting marine life.,That also helps local communities dependent on fishing or tourism.,“Restoration will not save corals at the current rate we’re losing them,” said Gavin Miller, a marine scientist with the Global Reef organization in Thailand.,“It’s more about these localized impacts and the scale and the awareness that you can raise from there.”",https://globalnation.inquirer.net/241677/how-restoration-can-help-coral-reefs
Hajj pilgrims ‘stone the devil’ as Muslims mark Eid al-Adha,," , / 10:57 PM June 17, 2024","MINA, SAUDI ARABIA — Pilgrims on Sunday performed the last major ritual of the hajj, the “stoning of the devil,” in western Saudi Arabia as Muslims around the globe celebrated the Eid al-Adha holiday.,As one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings wound down, authorities from multiple countries said at least 22 people had died, many of them from “extreme heat,” highlighting the acute physical toll of the annual rites which in recent years have fallen during the oven-like Saudi summer.,Beginning at dawn, the 1.8 million Muslims undertaking the pilgrimage this year threw seven stones at each of three concrete walls symbolizing the devil in the Mina valley, located outside Islam’s holiest city of Mecca.,The ritual commemorates Abraham’s stoning of the devil at the three spots where it is said Satan tried to dissuade him from obeying God’s order to sacrifice his son.,Multiple stampedes have occurred in Mina over the years, most recently in 2015 when up to 2,300 worshippers were killed in the worst hajj disaster.,The site has been revamped since then to streamline the movement of the large crowds.,Roads leading to the concrete walls were nevertheless packed on Sunday, with some pilgrims struggling under the morning sun.,Temperatures soared well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) each day and on Saturday hit 46 degrees Celsius (114.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Mount Arafat, where pilgrims performed hours of outdoor prayers.,Jordan’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that 14 Jordanian pilgrims had died “after suffering sun stroke due to the extreme heat wave,” and that 17 others were “missing.”,Iran reported the deaths of five pilgrims but did not specify the cause, while Senegal’s foreign ministry said that three others had died.,Saudi Arabia has not provided any information on fatalities.,During last year’s hajj at least 240 people—many from Indonesia—died, according to figures announced by various countries which also did not specify causes of death.,There were also more than 10,000 cases of heat-related illnesses, 10 percent of which were heatstroke, a health ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse (AFP).,Worshippers did their best to take the taxing conditions in stride, seizing what for many was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pray at Islam’s holiest shrines.,One treatment center near Mount Arafat recorded 225 cases of heat stress and fatigue so far, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.,One of the five pillars of Islam, the hajj must be performed at least once by all Muslims with the means.,This year’s figure of 1.8 million pilgrims is similar to last year’s, and Saudi authorities said on Saturday that 1.6 million of them came from abroad.,These included 17,500 Syrians, according to Badreddine Mansour, director of a Saudi agency specializing in pilgrimages.,For Syrians living in government-controlled areas, hajj has long been out of reach but the reintegration of President Bashar Assad’s government into the Arab fold last year has enabled direct flights to the pilgrimage.,Sunday’s stoning ritual coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, which honors Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son before God offered a sheep instead. —Agence France-Presse",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1952400/hajj-pilgrims-stone-the-devil-as-muslims-mark-eid-al-adha

Why some workers might view a manager’s toxic behavior as tough love,," , / 01:58 PM July 13, 2024","Social networks are full of testimonials from employees forced to work with , managers. The phenomenon is so widespread that it has become a subject of sociological research in recent years.,While many studies focus on the characteristics of abusive bosses, few examine the reasons why workers put up with this damaging form of authority.,Researchers at Ohio State University and Providence College studied the psychological mechanisms at work when dealing with a problematic manager. To do this, they first surveyed 576 US workers from a variety of industries. They asked them three times over a six-week period about the abusive behaviors of their hierarchical superior and the latter’s effectiveness at work.,The researchers found that employees tend to minimize their manager’s abusive behavior when they consider their leader’s performance to be high. From their point of view, their superior’s excesses are the expression of a form of tough love, not maladaptive behavior.,On the other hand, workers are much more likely to identify their boss’s managerial excesses when they seem incompetent.,“If employees see their boss as a successful leader, that seems to be incompatible with being abusive. So they label the abuse as something more positive, like tough love,” says study lead author Robert Lount, quoted in a news release.,But what accounts for these differing interpretations? Optimism, it seems.,Indeed, employees with a high regard for their abusive manager are convinced that kindness will eventually win out over ruthlessness. They believe they will eventually be rewarded for their efforts, for example, with a promotion.,“These bosses may treat employees harshly, but presumably their intent is to help their followers realize their potential — that’s the tough love part. And if the leaders have high performance, that suggests they are successful at bringing out the skills of their followers,” says study coauthor Bennett Tepper.,Since the first part of their study was based on statements, the scientists decided to conduct a laboratory experiment to support their reasoning.,They recruited 168 undergraduate students, who were led to believe that they were going to work in teams under the supervision of an MBA student to solve a problem. While they were working, the volunteers received a message supposedly sent by their team leader.,The message was written in such a way as to be either non-abusive (“Try hard!”) or more aggressive (“Don’t waste my time coming up with stupid ideas! Do better than a typical undergrad and don’t embarrass us!”),Each team had to present its ideas to the team leader before they were examined by an independent expert. The researchers would then let the participants know whether they had done better or worse than their competitors. Whatever the result, the students were then asked to rate their supervisor.,Unsurprisingly, the students were less affected by their team leader’s abusive behavior when the researchers told them they had performed well on the exercise. Conversely, those who had underperformed were more likely to say they had been the victims of abusive management.,“We found that in a very short amount of time, you could quickly abate abusive labeling of a boss with high performance,” says Robert Lount.,The findings of this study show that employees can turn a blind eye to their superior’s toxic behavior if they think that the leader achieves high performance at work. This psychological phenomenon, which is in a sense similar to cognitive dissonance, could explain why toxic management is so insidious.,But it is no less harmful.,Employees who are exposed to it may experience symptoms similar to those associated with other forms of workplace harassment, such as sleep disorders, dark moods, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1960759/why-some-workers-might-view-a-managers-toxic-behavior-as-tough-love

We need to raise the standards and practices in this crucial sector by investing in education, training, and skills upgrading of all the personnel who are working in this industry,” the President said.,He said the country would require experts and professionals from different fields to help make tourism “a meaningful and educational, and impactful experience not only for tourists but also for our stakeholders.”,“For what good will any tourism effort be if it ends up destroying the local culture and ecology,” Marcos added.,He also reassured industry players that the government would continue to work with the private sector in implementing reforms that would make tourists “visit, stay, spend and return” to the Philippines.,These include easing visa access, improving water sanitation and healthcare facilities in major tourist destinations, and better connectivity hubs such as airports.,“By adopting these practices, we create a tourism industry that not only creates responsible visitors but also uplifts the lives of those who are part of that activity,” the President said, adding that tourism has a vital role in economies and societies.,He cited the tourism industry’s contribution to the 2023 gross domestic product, which hit 8.6 percent or P2.09 trillion ($35 billion).,“This marks the highest record of growth in gross value added in tourism since the year 2000. This is an impressive increase of 48 percent compared to the previous year’s numbers,” he said.,Marcos also noted that in 2023, the Philippines welcomed 5.45 million foreign tourists, exceeding the year’s target of 4.8 million foreign visitors.,For January to March 2024, international tourist arrivals were recorded at 2.9 million, which Marcos said was proof of the “robust recovery and continued appeal of our country as a top travel destination.”,“But going beyond monetary values and numbers, these figures also mean millions of lives being changed for the better. That’s why I hope that our efforts here will lead to even better practices and more tourism arrivals not just for our country but for the entire world,” he added.,After the event in Lapu-Lapu City, the President went to Tagbilaran City in Bohol where he turned over P100 million to the provincial governments of Bohol and Cebu to be given as assistance to El Niño-hit farmers and fishermen.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1956137/marcos-going-green-good-for-ph-tourism

Transforms stigma into opportunity as Filipinos support formalizing habal-habal,," , / 05:30 AM July 15, 2024","Angkas has come a long way in shaping and changing public perception about motorcycle taxis (MC Taxis). The company’s efforts have not only increased awareness but have also created significant advocacy that has led to the industry’s success. According to WR Numero, a leading research firm in the Philippines, awareness of Angkas is notably high, with 48% of Filipinos recognizing the brand. Furthermore, the study reveals that 45% of Filipino participants now use habal-habal for transportation, with 14% reporting regular usage and 11% using it two to four times weekly.,A recently published study by WR Numero reveals that 58% of Filipinos “agree with or strongly support” the legitimization of habal-habal, an unregulated motorcycle transport service. Additionally, 78% of Filipinos consider having an advocate in Congress essential, underscoring the significance of MC Taxis in the lives of Filipino commuters. The WR Numero Philippine Public Opinion Monitor, a pioneering and innovative public opinion research initiative, surveyed individuals 18 years and older nationwide regarding habal-habal. These findings highlight Angkas’ instrumental role in bringing nationwide awareness and advocacy for the motorcycle taxi industry.,Since its inception in 2016, Angkas has tirelessly worked to dispel the belief that using motorcycles to ferry passengers is unsafe, proving that with proper training and education, motorcycle taxis can be a viable and safe alternative form of transportation. The company has set new standards in the industry, demonstrating its commitment to safety and reliability. By 2019, Angkas had established its safety credentials with a remarkable 99.997 percent safety record, as presented in multiple court and congressional hearings. This success led to the Department of Transportation (DOTr) forming a technical working group (DOTr-TWG) to pilot a feasibility study on MC Taxis, with Angkas and 2 other players participating.,Transitioning from the achievements of Angkas, George Royeca, co-founder and now CEO, has emerged as a leading transport advocate. For nearly a decade, Royeca has championed job opportunities for habal-habal riders and provided legitimate two-wheel transport options for commuters. His visionary leadership has been central to Angkas’ success and the elevation of the motorcycle taxi industry.,In its early days, Angkas faced multiple threats of termination due to regulatory challenges and skepticism about the safety of MC Taxis. Royeca addressed these concerns by implementing rigorous biker training and promoting excellent service delivery to ensure safety and viability. To date, over 50,000 motorcycle drivers have been lifted out of poverty through Angkas, thanks to Royeca’s biker welfare initiatives like reliable loan programs, benefits, and incentives that formalized the once-informal habal-habal sector.,Royeca’s dedication to the motorcycle taxi industry and his advocacy efforts have paved the way for significant developments. The strong support (58%) for legitimizing habal-habal riders underscores the success of Royeca and Angkas in advocating for the inclusion of the informal sector in the country’s labor force and in offering commuters a safe, quick, and comfortable transport experience. Currently, Congress is working on regulatory laws for MC Taxis, structured according to the TWG’s recommendations. Royeca and Angkas’ belief in habal-habal riders has paved the way for this historic development in the local transport industry.,Angkas’ success in reaching nationwide consciousness and creating awareness and advocacy has been pivotal in the motorcycle taxi industry’s growth. George Royeca’s leadership and relentless advocacy have made him a champion of the industry and the 18 million-strong motorcycle rider community. Together, Angkas and George Royeca continue to drive forward the industry, ensuring a brighter future for millions of motorcycle riders across the Philippines.",https://globalnation.inquirer.net/242419/transforms-stigma-into-opportunity-as-filipinos-support-formalizing-habal-habal
BIR: Online sellers must now pay withholding tax,Mariedel Irish U. Catilogo," , / 05:55 AM July 17, 2024","MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on Tuesday said electronic marketplace operators such as Shopee and Lazada have started collecting the withholding tax on sellers or merchants using their platforms.,“Electronic marketplace operators will begin imposing a withholding tax against their sellers/merchants starting July 15, 2024. We have already extended this by 90 days. No further extensions will be given,” BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. said in a statement.,In December last year, the BIR issued Revenue Regulation 16-2023 requiring online merchants with earnings of more than P500,000 annually to be subjected to a 1-percent withholding tax.,The tax will apply to half of the gross remittances by electronic marketplace operators and digital financial services providers (DFSP) such as GCash and Maya that sellers or merchants use in selling their goods or services through digital platforms. DFSPs also include credit card providers facilitating the settlement of transactions made through the internet and mobile phones.,Gross remittances refer to the total amount received by an e-market operator or e-wallet provider from the online buyers of the goods and services.,The BIR circular provided a 90-day extension to allow affected parties to make the necessary adjustments before the withholding tax is actually imposed.,“The withholding tax is not a new tax. It’s merely a system of taxation where taxes are collected at source, which will be credited against the total income tax liability of the sellers/merchants,” Lumagui noted.,“The BIR aims to level the playing field between brick-and-mortar stores, which are regularly complying with their tax obligations, and online marketplaces. Whether their business is operated online or through physical stores, sellers and merchants have to pay their taxes,” Lumagui said.,The BIR defines e-marketplace as a digital service platform that connects online buyers with online sellers; facilitates and concludes sales, and processes the payment of the products, goods, or services online.,Aside from online shopping platforms, this also includes digital food delivery services and other sites using booking resort, hotel and other lodging accommodations.,The tax agency has required online sellers and merchants to register their businesses with the BIR and submit a copy of their registration certificate to the e-marketplace operator and DFSP before using their online facilities.,For those seeking exemption, merchants must submit a BIR-received sworn declaration to the online platform and DFSP stating that the total gross remittance they are to receive from the e-marketplace operators will not exceed P500,000.,Aside from the obligation to withhold applicable taxes before remitting the sales proceeds or payments to sellers, e-marketplace operators and DFSPs must likewise ensure that all sellers are registered with the BIR before allowing them to use their facility.,At the same time, the mobile payment service or e-wallet used for customer payments must be for the account of the seller’s BIR-registered trade name, for example, a customer using GCash must pay to a store’s BIR-registered GCash account and not to the owner’s GCash number.,Roberto Claudio, president of the Philippine Retailers Association, on Tuesday said that while the move was in the right direction, they were confused as to the intention of the memorandum and the specifics of the 1-percent withholding tax.,“If this is the tax to be paid by their foreign merchants and sellers, we find this completely unfair to local retailers who have to contend with a 12-percent value-added tax (VAT),” Claudio told the Inquirer in a message.,If such is the case, a rechargeable battery, for example, sold by a local store will pay the 12-percent VAT, while an online foreign seller will pay only a 1-percent withholding tax for a similar item, he said.,Marketplaces such as Shopee, Lazada, Zalora, TikTok and Shein pay taxes only on the commission they earn from using their platforms and not the VAT, which results in an unfair advantage against local retailers, Claudio added.,Claudio noted that the BIR still has to explain the specifics of the 1-percent withholding tax and how it would be applied to online merchants or sellers.,Many sellers using the top two online shopping sites, Shopee and Lazada, are from China.,Robert Dan Roces, chief economist at Security Bank Corp., said he expected a mixed impact of the latest BIR measure on consumers and sellers.,“While it might generate revenue for the governments, it could also lead to higher prices, reduced choices,” he said.,Roces noted that balancing tax collection goals with practical challenges faced by online sellers would be crucial for the success of the new tax regime.,Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. chief economist Michael Ricafort said that the agency’s move would be more effective in tax collections and would expand the tax revenue sources of the government, especially in the coming years as more businesses decide to use online transactions.,“Given the boom in e-commerce and online businesses worldwide, it makes a lot of economic and fiscal sense to make this a major government revenue source for the years to come,” Ricafort said.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1961672/bir-online-sellers-must-now-pay-withholding-tax

(KACI) despite being unqualified for PDAF transfer, citing a report from the Commission on Audit (COA).,According to Malonzo, a similar case was filed by the Office of the Ombudsman, wherein it found “probable cause” for violations related to graft, malversation of public funds, and falsification of public documents in 2017 but it was reversed in 2019 due to “insufficiency of evidence.”,“Similar to the case of Janet Lim Napoles, Congressman Oca Malapitan endorsed and used an NGO to embezzle government funds, a known modus used by politicians during that time. With the new evidence presented, I hope that the Ombudsman will indict the named respondents and let them face trial for graft and malversation,” Malonzo’s statement read.,“Documents gathered from COA revealed that the amounts in question that were released to KACI remain unliquidated after more than a decade. The COA Special Audits Office Report No. 2012-034 on PDAF, which was not previously considered in the case, outlined several discrepancies in the documents submitted and found illegalities in the transaction,” it added.,A 2021 report also showed that Malonzo’s son then-Caloocan City Councilor Christopher PJ Malonzo, Marylou Nubla, and Alexander Mangasar also filed a graft case against Malapitan, former Education Undersecretary Alain del Pascua, and former Caloocan City Treasurer Analiza Mendiola.,The complaint stemmed from the alleged purchasing of 64,000 “unusable” tablets worth P320 million without proper bidding.,INQUIRER.net sought the side of Malapitan on the case, but he has yet to reply as of posting.,Caloocan City Public Information Office chief Princess Garcia said they believe the complaints against Malapitan and other succeeding complaints that Malonzo will file against the lawmaker are all “politically motivated.”",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1961589/ex-caloocan-mayor-malonzo-files-graft-rap-vs-rep-malapitan
