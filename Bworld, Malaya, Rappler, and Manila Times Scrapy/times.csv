Accord sets up hotline for Sino, PH presidents
","

","
July 17, 2024
","A RECENTLY signed agreement will open a direct line of communication between China and the Philippines' presidential offices to try and prevent any new confrontation from spiraling out of control in the disputed South China Sea, according to highlights of the accord seen by The Associated Press on Tuesday.,China and the Philippines have forged such emergency telephone hotlines at lower levels of their bureaucracies in the past to better manage their disputes, particularly in two fiercely disputed shoals where the Philippines has accused Chinese forces of increasingly hostile actions and China says Philippine ships have encroached despite repeated warnings.,The territorial faceoffs, however, have persisted uncontrollably in the past year, sparking fears of a larger armed conflict that could involve the United States, which has repeatedly warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines, a key Asian treaty ally, if Filipino forces come under an armed attack in the disputed waters.,In a confrontation between Chinese and Philippine forces at the Philippines-occupied Second Thomas Shoal in August 2023, the Philippine government said it was unable to reach Chinese officials through an established ""maritime communication mechanism"" for several hours as the clash happened. That emergency telephone hotline was arranged after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in January 2023.,Chinese and Philippine officials dealing with the territorial disputes held crucial talks in Manila on July 2, following a violent confrontation in the Second Thomas Shoal in which Chinese coast guard personnel reportedly wielded knives, an axe and improvised spears in a chaotic faceoff that injured Philippine navy personnel and damaged two of their motorboats. The Chinese forces also seized seven Philippine navy rifles, said the Philippine military chief, who demanded China return the firearms and pay for the damages.,Both sides ""recognized the need to strengthen the bilateral maritime communication mechanism on the South China Sea"" and signed an arrangement ""on improving Philippines-China maritime communication mechanisms,"" the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement after the talks in Manila but did not provide a copy or details of the agreement.,A copy of the highlights of the agreement, seen by the AP, said it ""provides several channels for communication between the Philippines and China, specifically on maritime issues, through the representatives to be designated by their leaders."",The hotline talks could also be done ""through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Foreign Affairs counterparts, including at the foreign minister and vice foreign minister levels or through their designated representatives,"" it said, and added without elaborating that Philippine officials were ""in discussions with the Chinese side on the guidelines that will govern the implementation of this arrangement."",There was also a plan to set up a new communication channel between the Chinese and Philippine coast guards ""once the corresponding memorandum of understanding"" between them is concluded, according to the agreement.,During the recent talks in Manila, China and the Philippines agreed on two other confidence-boosting steps to intensify ""cooperation between their respective coast guard authorities"" and the possible convening of a maritime forum between Chinese and Philippine scientists and academic leaders.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/07/17/news/national/accord-sets-up-hotline-for-sino-ph-presidents/1957724

Humane approach to incarceration eases prison overcrowding
","
By UN News
","
July 17, 2024
","A MORE humane approach to dealing with people accused of breaking the law in the Philippines is helping relieve overcrowding in one of the world's most congested prison systems.,At the Manila City Jail, prisoners lie in neat rows as they demonstrate how they sleep every night.,In male dormitory number 4, most do not have a mattress or even a bed; indeed, it's not even possible due to a lack of space to lie down on your back.,Instead, prisoners wearing their regulation yellow prison T-shirts curl up on their sides, often using their immediate neighbor as a pillow as they struggle to get a proper night's sleep in humid and cramped conditions.,Carlo has been incarcerated and awaiting trial for six years. He told UN News that ""men sleep in rows of maybe 200 to the end of the dormitory, and it's difficult to move,"" adding that although ""it is not comfortable, as years go by, I have become accustomed to sleeping on my side. People on the outside may find this depressing, but comfort is a relative term."",A recent unprecedented heat wave in Manila has driven the temperatures in this shared dormitory to over 40 degrees Celsius at night, making conditions even more inhumane for prisoners, with Carlo experiencing ""constant insomnia."",Manila City Jail was originally built in 1847 and is one of the oldest prisons in the Philippines.,Today, its official capacity is just under 1,200 prisoners although there are currently some 3,200 men accommodated there, an overcrowding rate that equates to a 168 percent overcapacity.,The jail superintendent Warden Lino Montano Soriano has been tasked with reducing the prison population as far as his responsibilities allow. Since he assumed the jail leadership, he instructed his deputy ""to check all the records of the prisoners because I presumed that many of them already had their expected date of release."",Progress to ease the overcrowding is slow but is moving in the right direction. In March 2024, 288 prisoners were admitted into the jail, while 354 were released.,Red tape is far from being the main reason for overcrowding in detention facilities in the Philippines. A controversial justice policy that targeted drug dealers and people who use drugs contributed significantly to the prison population rising from around 95,000 to over 165,000 between 2015 and 2021.,The Philippines now has one of the most congested prison systems in the world, and with an overall occupation rate for pre-trial jails of a reported 322 percent (down from 365 percent in 2023), it ranks close to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and Uganda in terms of overcrowding.,Many detainees must endure long periods of pre-trial detention before they have their day in court or are released without a trial.,The authorities in the Philippines have recognized that change is needed.,Supreme Court Justice Maria Filomena Singh is committed to improving conditions in correctional facilities, which crucially includes decongestion.,She has also regularly visited women's jails: ""These are mothers, these are daughters, these are wives, and I relate to them,"" she told UN News, adding that ""we cannot call ourselves a just and humane society if there are people living like this among us."",There are a number of ways the authorities in the Philippines are lowering incarceration rates.,The release of prisoners ages 70 or above is being prioritized, and others are able to reduce their sentences through good behavior but also an innovative program called Read Your Way Out, which links a commitment to reading activities to an earlier release.,Significantly, efforts are being made to keep people out of jail in the first place by reducing people in pre-trial detention and incarcerating people for only the most serious offenses.,""Of all those people detained in our jails, around 70 percent have not yet finished their trial. So, they are there on preventive imprisonment even if their offenses are not serious,"" Singh said.,""These people have not yet been proven guilty, and yet we treat them no differently from those who have already been convicted."",Reducing payments to secure bail while waiting for trial has been another priority. Additional changes are being made to criminal procedures to keep people out of jail where they are ""literally unproductive,"" a situation where families that are dependent on the incarcerated person ""are deprived of their support,"" according to Singh.,Prisoners can also attend court appearances online from certain jails, which is also helping to speed up the typically slow patch to justice.,Some 70 percent of all incarcerated people in the Philippines are in custody for sometimes minor drug offenses, the result of the previous administration's highly punitive war on drugs.,While the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has supported moves to implement bail reduction, the priority release of elderly prisoners and the Read Your Way Out program, it has also prioritized support to the government to change the overall approach to drug-related crimes.,""Drugs are not just a law enforcement issue; they are a health issue as well, which should be seen through the lens of prevention and rehabilitation,"" said Daniele Marchesi, UNODC's country chief in the Philippines. ""It's a complex problem that connects the judiciary, the police and other law enforcement agencies on issues including health, drug policy and human rights."",The new approach appears to be paying dividends with the release of some 8,000 prisoners in the last year Singh said.

","SENATE President Francis Escudero said Tuesday a broader manhunt would be launched for Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo, if she continues to hide instead of cooperating with the Senate panel looking into her alleged involvement with unlicensed Philippine overseas gaming operators (POGOs).,On Saturday, in coordination with the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms (OSAA) deployed four teams to serve arrest orders against Guo and seven others but failed to locate them as they were not in their given addresses.,Retired Lt. Gen. Roberto Ancan, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, reported to Escudero that the OSAA teams failed to serve the arrest warrants since Guo and the others.,Escudero said they were considering mounting a broader manhunt for Guo and company if they continue to snub the invitation of the Senate to attend the July 29 hearing of the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality chaired by Sen. Risa Hontiveros.,
,The Senate chief instructed Ancan to collaborate with the National Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies to ensure the attendance of Guo and other relevant individuals during the forthcoming hearings on POGO-related issues.,Meanwhile, Stephen David, Guo's lawyer, said his client was still in the country and had advised her to voluntarily appear before the Senate.,""We were able to talk for more than an hour via Zoom. Of course, my advice to her [is to surrender], as she cannot hide forever,"" David said.,He told her the warrant of arrest was only issued by the Senate to compel her to testify as a resource person.,""The Senate warrant of arrest is not meant to penalize her. She was subpoenaed to testify as a resource person because they (senators) want to ask her questions only she can answer. If she will be able to answer, eventually, the arrest order will be lifted,"" David added.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/07/17/news/national/manhunt-for-guo-to-widen/1957854

","A MANIFESTO circulating among active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) seeks the ouster of Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., saying he lacks the competence to lead the Department of National Defense (DND) and the professionalism to take full responsibility for his actions.,The AFP did not issue a statement when asked about the manifesto but denied a related report posted by a retired general online about an alleged walkout by ranking military officials during a July 4 command conference to protest Teodoro's handling of the West Philippine Sea situation.,""It is not only based on unfounded information, his comments were also misleading and uncharacteristic of any military officer, active or retired,"" the AFP said in a statement.,""Our soldiers are professional and loyal to the chain of command. We will not allow any effort to malign our ranks and discredit our commitment to our mandate by clout-chasers and their personal political agenda,"" it added.,At a press briefing in Villamor Air Base, Philippine Air Force Public Affairs Office chief Col. Ma Consuelo Castillo said reports of the walkout were ""fake news."",""Nothing of that sort happened; it was a very professional exchange of ideas and discussions and there were also a lot of updates that were given. It all ended on a positive note,"" Castillo said.,Efforts to reach Teodoro were unsuccessful.,In the manifesto addressed to the President, a copy of which The Manila Times obtained, the signatories pointed to the routine rotation and resupply (RoRe) mission to BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal that was conducted by the AFP on June 17, during which vessels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army-Navy (PLA-N), China Coast Guard (CCG) and Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) engaged in dangerous maneuvers, including ramming and towing a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel.,The incident ""humiliated the ranks of the entire military service"" and is a direct result of Teodoro's supposed ""narcissistic attitude and ambitious pursuit of getting elected to a national post,"" the manifesto said.,""Secretary Teodoro unilaterally decided to carry out this operation, disregarding the opposing comments from military planners and strategists at the AFP and DND,"" the manifesto alleged.,The RoRe operation was allegedly never approved or even discussed at the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea or the National Maritime Council, the manifesto added.,Furthermore, it claimed that the planning of the ""abysmal military operation was never shared with any of the concerned government agencies that have a clear stake in the West Philippine Sea issue."",It said Teodoro's ""hasty and unreasonable decision"" to push for the military-led RoRe operation ""indicates a lack of strategic thinking in managing the West Philippine Sea issue."",""It appears that his main concern is to maximize his own publicity, rather than considering the potential consequences and risks of such an operation,"" the manifesto said. ""It is concerning that he failed to take into account the high possibility of miscalculation and the potential escalation to war."",In addition, it claimed that there is ""frustration and anger"" within the AFP regarding the unceremonious relief of Vice Adm. Alberto Carlos, who is currently in floating status.,""We recognize such unfairness, as Vice Admiral Carlos is a patriotic soldier with a lengthy military service to our country,"" they said.,The manifesto said the problem in the West Philippine Sea will only worsen if Teodoro continues to ""prioritize his publicity stunts instead of de-escalating the tension that he has created."",Earlier, retired BGen. Johnny Macanas Jr. claimed in a video posted online that ranking AFP officials reportedly walked out during the command conference in Camp Aguinaldo last July 4 as a sign of disagreement and protest supposedly against Teodoro.,Macanas cited a ""blind item"" on a radio program that alleged a military general participating in the command conference suddenly stood up, saluted Teodoro, the top civilian government official presiding the meeting, and asked permission to leave.,As the general was leaving the room, several military generals also stood up and proceeded to walk out of the meeting.,The names and identities of the AFP officials who walked out were not revealed.,The AFP, however, said on Tuesday that there was no truth to the radio commentary.,It also called on the public to be critical of false narratives and report individuals and channels that propagate disinformation.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/07/17/news/national/afp-denies-walkout-reports-manifesto-seeks-gibos-ouster/1957850

Think tank: Government has to invest more in digital infrastructure

","MANILA, Philippines — THE government has to pour in more funds to the country's digital infrastructure if it wants to catch up with neighboring countries in terms of internet speed and coverage, a public policy reform think tank said.,CitizenWatch PH lead convenor Orlando Oxales said on Wednesday beefing up investments in the country's digital foundation will not only address the broadband infrastructure gap between the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations but will also help empower people and industries in the internet world.,Oxales cited Ooklas' Speed Test Global Index that showed the country's broadband speeds trailing behind Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore by more than half.,He attributed the Philippines' bleak performance in terms of internet speed to the shortage of digital infrastructure.,Oxales said that the government has earmarked less funds to its National Broadband Plan compared to other Asian neighbors.,The budget for the said program under the Department of Information and Communications Technology totaled only $32 million while Indonesia has put up $2.06 billion to further boost its internet capacity, Malaysia poured $5.1 billion, Singapore, $2.8 billion and China, $1.4 trillion.,A 2023 study conducted by international consulting firm Arthur D. Little showed that the Philippines had the second lowest cumulative investment in fiber coverage and targets among SEA countries.,The study showed that the Philippines needs to spend around $1.1 billion (roughly P58.30 billion) to reach the required target coverage levels considering that the country also has the second lowest take-up rate and penetration rate among internet users as of 2022.,A World Bank report said that the Philippines' internet connectivity is the most expensive in the Southeast Asian region but is relatively slow compared to Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei.,Oxales said that the Philippines needs to invest more and at least match neighboring countries' investment in broadband infrastructure, implement reforms like incentives, invest in education and training, and collaborate better with the private sector to properly leverage the country's resources and expertise.,One way to increase the country's internet speed in the Philippines is by adding more cell sites and giving incentives to telcos, he said., ,The Philippines needs an additional 60,000 cell sites by 2031 in Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas, according to data from the Asian Development Bank.,The World Bank said policymakers should focus on reforms and invest more budget to improve the Philippines' broadband infrastructure, as the slow internet connection affects many people and future opportunities.,""A coordinated approach where both the government and private sector would align their resources and strategies is crucial to enhancing the country's digital capabilities and ensuring broadband connectivity that meets global standards,"" Oxales said.,""By aligning government resources with the aggressive and forward-looking investment outlook of the private telcos, the country can bridge the connectivity gap and enable local industries to compete and thrive in the borderless global digital economy,"" he added.",https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/07/17/news/think-tank-government-has-to-invest-more-in-digital-infrastructure/1957934
