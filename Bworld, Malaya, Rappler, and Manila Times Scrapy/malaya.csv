SC asked: Cite Comelec chief  in contempt over Miru case,...,"July 17, 2024","FORMER Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice yesterday asked the Supreme Court (SC) to cite Elections chairman George Garcia in contempt for allegedly violating the sub judice rule when he publicly commented on the petition seeking to void the contract between the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the South Korean-led joint venture company Miru Systems that won the P17.9 billion contract for the Automated Election System (AES) to be used in the 2025 national and local elections.,In a three-page motion, Erice said Garcia violated the sub judice rule when he said that the poll body may “resort to a manual 2025 national and local elections” if the High Court issues a ruling invalidating the Miru contract.,“In making the above statements, chairman George Garcia, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the Comelec, threatened this Court that an adverse ruling will result to a return to the conduct of a manual election,” Erice said, stressing that this violated the sub judice prohibition.,The sub judice rule prohibits the discussion of the merits of a case being heard in court to avoid prejudging the issue, influencing the court, or obstructing the administration of justice.,Erice said Garcia’s comment is a “downright irresponsible behavior.”,Garcia scoffed at Erice’s motion, saying it is absurd that the former lawmaker is the one accusing him of violating the sub judice rule when it was actually him who has been publicly speaking about his petition against the poll automation contract.,“Who’s frequently calling for press conferences? Who is the one with several interviews? Ako po ay may isang dangkal ng lahat ng sinabi (niya) sa press conference at saka sa mga interview (I have a collection of what he has been saying in his press conferences and interviews),” said Garcia.,“If I really have bad intentions, I would have filed a motion to cite him in contempt. But I didn’t do that,” he added.,As to the motion filed in the SC, the poll chief said he welcomes the latest challenge from Erice.,“This would be good as the people will know who is lying and who is telling the truth,” said Garcia, explaining that the statements he supposedly made in violation of the sub judice rule are merely responses to questions regarding their preparations for the 2025 elections.,“During my interviews as chairman of the Comelec, I merely respond to questions how are our preparations for the elections. I merely answer the questions as the person in authority as it is part of our mandate,” said Garcia.,Meanwhile, the SC en banc directed Erice to answer the petition of Miru for the issuance of a “confidentiality and protective gag order” to prevent him from discussing and disclosing information on the case to a third party.,SC spokesperson Camille Sue Ting said the justices have directed Erice to answer the petition within a “non-extendible period of 10 days from notice.”,In a related development, Garcia challenged his critics to make their allegations that he has several bank accounts with alleged deposits from South Korea under oath.,He said doing so would prove that their allegations are serious. “What is happening is really wrong. Why? They are making accusations but aren’t doing so under oath. Question, are they prepared to put under oath their allegations?” he asked.,In contrast, he said it is actually him, the one who is being accused, who is coming out with sworn statements and affidavits.,“I am the one accused but it is I that is seeking certifications and issuing sworn statements,” said Garcia.,He cited as an example the certifications from Land Bank of the Philippines and Metrobank that the alleged bank accounts he owns are actually “non-existent”.,Aside from LandBank and Metrobank, the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) also issued a similar certification over the alleged bank accounts of Garcia.,According to BPI – Alfaro Branch Manager Zyra May Oswa, no such bank accounts exist in their records.,“Please be informed that bank information in your Letter is/are spurious,” said Oswa.,Last Monday, Erice submitted to the Comelec several documents, which he labeled as the “Bahamas files,” supposedly from an anonymous sender containing details of the foreign and local bank accounts of a poll official.,Garcia quickly responded by saying he is the one being alluded to by Erice but denied the allegations of having several bank accounts.,Meanwhile, Garcia got a shot in the arm after gaining the backing of the Comelec – Employees’ Union (Comelec-EU), which said in a short statement that they agree with the Comelec chief that the allegations are merely part of a “demolition job” aimed at discrediting the forthcoming elections.,“We agree with chairman Garcia that this is a well-oiled demolition job that is clearly meant to erode the public’s trust on the automated election system,” said the Comelec-EU.,The union with 5,000 members also said they do not see the issues as a mere attack on Garcia, but rather to the entire institution.,“As election frontliners, we can not stand idly by as our beloved institution and our leaders are maligned with allegations and insinuations that are so blatantly unfounded and absurd,” said the Comelec-EU.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/sc-asked-cite-comelec-chief-in-contempt-over-miru-case/
Navy: Fewer Chinese boats seen  in WPS after China-PH meeting,Victor Reyes,"July 17, 2024","THE military has observed a significant decrease in the number of Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea in the South China since the Philippines and China agreed to de-escalate tension in the area two weeks ago, the Navy said yesterday.,There were 153 Chinese vessels monitored in the area before the convening of the 9th Bilateral Consultation Mechanism (BCM) on July 2, said Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad, Navy spokesman for the West Philippine Sea.,Trinidad, in a press briefing at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City, said Chinese and Philippine representatives had a “frank and constructive discussion on the situation in the South China Sea” and “affirmed their commitment to de-escalate tensions without prejudice to their respective positions.”,“For the past month, the highest number (of Chinese vessels) based on our monitoring was 153 PLA (People’s Liberation Army), Coast Guard and maritime militia (vessels),” said Trinidad.,Based on their monitoring for the period July 9 to 15, only 104 Chinese vessels were monitored, he said.,“There was a decrease. Whether this is because of the BCM, it still remains to be seen,” said Trinidad.,“We will know about this when we conduct the next RoRe (rotation and reprovisioning). But for now, our basis for our assessment is the number of ships that we have monitored,” said Trinidad.,The last RoRe conducted by the Armed Forces for its troops stationed at the Philippine-held Ayungin Shoal was on June 17. The RoRe was harassed by the Chinese, causing severe injury to a Philippine Navy sailor. The Chinese took seven firearms and other equipment of the soldiers and destroyed P60 million worth of equipment, including two rigid-hull inflatable boats.,Trinidad declined to say when the next RoRe at Ayungin Shoal will be conducted, saying details of such missions are with the AFP Western Command based in Puerto Princesa City in Palawan.,As to actions taken by the Armed Forces to deescalate tension, Trinidad said they will just continue what they have been doing in the area.,“We will ensure that our actions are not escalatory. We will continue the RoRe missions. We will continue our maritime air surveillance flight, we will continue securing our features and the integrity of the national territory in the West Philippine Sea,” he said.,Trinidad said all of the AFP actions in the West Philippine Sea are governed by the rules of engagement and international law.,“Again, we have never been escalatory in our actions… Our actions will have to be within the rules of engagement and international law, they will not be escalatory… No changes, we will continue performing our mandate,” said Trinidad.,On Monday, American maritime expert Ray Powell reported a Chinese vessel, conducting “intrusive patrol,” was monitored some 60 nautical miles off Lubang Island in Occidental Mindoro.,Trinidad said the military is aware of the presence of the Chinese ship and this is not alarming. He noted that the vessel merely “transited 60 nautical miles west of mainland of Luzon.”,“The Philippine Navy has monitored the presence. It was a continuous passage west of Lubang Island, 60 nautical miles from mainland Luzon….(It’s) freedom of navigation, yes,” he said.,Visiting Gen. Charles Brown Jr, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US armed forces, and AFP chief Romeo Brawner Jr yesterday discussed measures meant to bolster relations of the two militaries.,“Our alliance with the United States remains a cornerstone of our national security,” Brawner said during the high-level meeting held at the AFP general headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo yesterday afternoon.,Brown arrived in the country last Monday for a “series of engagements” with Brawner and other Philippine military officials, the US Department of Defense (DOD) said.,The DOD said Brown “will tour one of the EDCA (Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement) sites during his visit” to the Philippines.,There are nine EDCA sites, all co-located at AFP facilities. The Americans are allowed to put up structures in these areas for prepositioning of equipment.,“Through continued collaboration and mutual support, we fortify our defense capabilities and ensure the stability of our region,” said Brawner, referring to the two armed forces.,Col. Xerxes Trinidad, chief of the AFP Public Affairs Office, said the meeting “underscored their commitment to Philippine-United States’ longstanding military alliance.”,Trinidad said the discussions focused on enhancing bilateral defense cooperation, strengthening joint military exercises, and addressing regional security challenges.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/navy-fewer-chinese-boats-seen-in-wps-after-china-ph-meeting/
"Castro, Satur eye appealing  conviction before CA",Wendell Vigilia,"July 17, 2024","REP. France Castro of the party-list group Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) yesterday said she, former Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Satur Ocampo, and their 11 fellow respondents may ask the Court of Appeals (CA) to reverse the decision of a court in Tagum City, Davao del Norte convicting them of child abuse for allegedly endangering the lives of minor Lumad students in 2018.,“I don’t know yet if we will still file a motion for reconsideration (with) the (Tagum City) court but I think this more of our counsel’s decision,” she said. “As we know the decision is not yet final we still have the CA and Supreme Court.”,Castro, a member of the militant Makabayan bloc at the House, said their camp is studying the option of going to the CA because they have option to appeal the conviction before the appellate court within 15 days after receiving the Tagum regional trial court’s decision.,The charges against Castro, former Bayan Muna Rep. Ocampo and the 11 other respondents accused them of holding 14 minor students during their solidarity mission in Talaingod, Davao del Norte in November 2018.,The complaint was filed by the local police and local social welfare development office.,The Tagum RTC, in a 25-page decision dated July 3, said Castro, Ocampo, and the 11 others violated Section 10 (a) of Republic Act 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act.,The court sentenced the 13 to imprisonment ranging from four to six years, and ordered them to pay, jointly and severally, P20,000 as civil indemnity and moral damages to each of the 14 minors, with an interest rate of 6 percent per annum until fully complied.,Castro slammed National Security Adviser Eduardo Año for praising the court’s decision, saying the former AFP chief and interior secretary under the Duterte administration has been persistently “red-tagging” them and spreading disinformation.,“We know that Año’s former boss Rodrigo Duterte is still influential in Mindanao and that the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) is hellbent on having us convicted on trumped-up charges,” she said. “These are nothing but further attempts to legitimize their red-tagging and perpetuate their campaign of harassment against progressive individuals and organizations.”,Año earlier said, “It doesn’t matter if you are prominent in society; the law is the law, and one has to be accountable for one’s actions.”,Castro said the court’s ruling has grave implications because “it sends a dangerous message that those who help children against the harassment of the military, paramilitary and the (NTF-ELCAC) will be punished.”,“In this situation where the power and influence of red-taggers have become dominant, true justice is set aside,” she said. “As it is, we will face this trumped-up charge head on even if we reach the Supreme Court.”,Castro, who has been teaching and fighting for children’s rights for the past 25 years, finds the conviction for child abuse, particularly ironic and emotionally challenging. “Of all cases, this… as a teacher, we’ve been taking care of our students for 25 years. Now, I’m being charged with child abuse,” she said.,The 14 minors in the solidarity mission were students of the Salugpungan Ta Tanu Ingkanuhan Community Learning Center Inc.,Castro and Ocampo’s group was conducting the National Solidarity Mission in Talaingod town to provide assistance to Lumad schools and investigate cases of alleged human rights violations perpetrated by the paramilitary group Alamara.,The paramilitary group was earlier blamed for forcibly closing the Salugpungan Lumad school.,Castro and Ocampo’s group, with the minors, was intercepted at a police and military checkpoint in coordination with the local social welfare and development office in Barangay Sto. Niño, Talaingod town on the night of Nov. 28, 2018.,The prosecution said the group “failed to present or show” any legal documents authorizing them to bring or transport the minors.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/castro-satur-eye-appealing-conviction-before-ca/
"Safety of Guo, family assured if they are detained at Senate  ",Raymond Africa,"July 17, 2024","THE Office of the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms yesterday assured the safety of suspended Bamban Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo, her family, and a resource person if they are detained on the strength of arrest warrants issued by the Senate Committee on Women for contempt.,Roberto Angcan, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, said a former daycare center beside a PNP station inside the Senate compound in Pasay City will serve as the detention center for Guo and her siblings Shiela, Siemen, and Wesley; father Jian Zhong Guo, and suspected mother Lin Wen Yi.,The Supreme Court, meanwhile, required the Senate panel chaired by Sen. Risa Hontiveros to answer the petition filed last week by Guo seeking the High Court’s intervention so she could not be forced to attend the Senate hearings on her alleged involvement in the operation of an illegal offshore gaming facility in her town.,SC spokesperson Camille Sue Ting said the Court en banc required the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality to “file its comment to the petition and prayer for temporary restraining order within a non-extendible period of 10 days from notice.”,Angcan said Senate President Francis Escudero wanted the Guo family detained at the former daycare center so they could be together.,He said Dennis Cunanan, the former director of the Technology and Livelihood Resource Center, can be detained in a room in the basement of the Senate building where Nancy Gamo, the Guo family’s accountant, is detained in another room.,Angcan said the Guo family’s would-be detention center has bunker beds with beddings and pillows, adding all of them, including Cunanan and Gamo, would be provided three meals a day “with snacks.”,He said their relatives can bring food if they want.,“Here, I can assure her security 24/7. I’ve done it before when I was a commander,” said Angcan, a retired military official who belongs to the Philippine Military Academy Class of 1987.,He said that Guo and her family may be encouraged to surrender now that their safety and security have been guaranteed.,“Nakita niyo naman may aircon. ‘Yung iba nga walang aircon, comfortable naman sila, and may toilet and bath, may water. Hindi siya hotel type but comfortable naman (Their room has an air-conditioning unit while other rooms do not. They will be comfortable here—they have their toilet and bath, with water supply. It is not of a hotel standard but at least they will be comfortable here),” he said.,Angcan said relatives and their legal counsels can visit them any time, while friends can be allowed during office hours after they have been screened.,He said electronic gadgets are still not allowed since easing that regulation is still under review on the order of Escudero.  He said the Guos and other detainees can use the OSAA phones should they want to contact someone outside.,Angcan said the Senate decided to use the former daycare center in anticipation of a large number of resource persons who would be ordered arrested by the Senate committee.,Last Monday, Stephen David, Guo’s legal counsel, said the suspended mayor is considering attending the next scheduled hearing on July 29 after she was told that she cannot be in hiding for the rest of her life.,Gou skipped the past hearings last June 26 and July 10, saying past hearings have taken a toll on her physical and mental health.,Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, in a chance interview yesterday, said he has been in contact with the school where Guo reportedly attended Grades 1 to 3 to get the names of her classmates who shared an old class picture showing their classmate Guo Hua Ping.,The National Bureau of Investigation had said that Mayor Guo and Guo Hua Ping, a Chinese who entered the country when she was 13 in 2003, are one and the same.,Gatchalian, who went to the same school where Go Hua Ping studied, said he learned of the class pictures in the news.,“May mga taong naging kaklase ni Guo Hua Ping from Grades 1 to 3. Kinukuha ko lang ang mga names ng alumni naming kung sino ‘yun para makausap ko mismo ang mga kaklase niya (There are people who are saying that Guo Hua Ping was their classmate from Grades 1 to 3. I am getting the names of our alumni so I can talk to them),” he said.,Gatchalian said Guo has not yet been arrested based on a report he asked from the OSAA yesterday.,He is confident that Guo cannot leave the country due to the arrest order of the Senate which has the effect of a hold departure order.,“Confident ako na nandito pa, unless pipilitin niyang mag backdoor sa Zamboanga, Tawi-tawi, then ibang usapan na iyon. Pero mga normal entry at exit points natin, naka-alerto na ang ating Bureau of Immigration (I am confident that she is still here unless she will force her way out using the backdoor in Zamboanga or Tawi-tawi, which is another issue. But as to the normal entry and exit points, our Bureau of Immigration has already been alerted),” he said.,Gatchalian also said the hearing scheduled on July 29 can be held even without Guo, adding he would focus on the partner of Guo regarding the issues of money laundering.,He said he was not surprised that Guo’s Facebook account had been deleted.,In her 78-page petition for certiorari, Guo, through David, also asked the High Court to annul the subpoena issued by Hontiveros’ panel.,“It is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that the instant petition be given due course and an order be issued directing the respondent Committee from further inviting or causing the Petitioner to appear as resource person on matters and resolutions subject of the Instant Letters and Subpoena Ad Testificandum,” Guo said in her plea.,She asked that a temporary restraining order and or writ of preliminary injunction be issued against the implementation of the Senate panel’s subpoena and from placing her as a resource person in the Senate inquiry.,In seeking the SC’s help, Guo said she was already adjudged guilty in the ongoing Senate probe.,Guo, who had been slapped with a six-month suspension by the Office of the Ombudsman while the investigation on her alleged involvement in the POGO operation in Bamban is ongoing, skipped last week’s Senate hearing, prompting the Senate committee to issue an arrest order against her.,Aside from her supposed involvement in the illegal POGO operation, Guo’s citizenship is also being questioned due to her inconsistent answers about her background and dubious documents regarding her Filipino citizenship.,Charges of human trafficking have also been filed against her before the Department of Justice while the Office of the Solicitor General asked a Tarlac court last week to cancel her birth certificate.,Guo has denied involvement in the POGO operation and insisted she is a Filipino citizen.,Camarines Sur Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte said authorities have to find out how foreigners have secured official documents from the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA) or the Bureau of Immigration (BI), which they use to pass themselves off as Filipinos.,“The case of the suspended mayor, who has not only been linked to POGOs believed engaged in serious crimes but even got herself elected as the first mayora (female mayor) of her hometown of Bamban (in Tarlac) despite her now questioned Filipino citizenship and background, should spur the full-blown investigation of how seemingly shady aliens like her have managed to obtain government documents and IDs (identification cards) attesting to their being legit Filipinos,” Villafuerte said.,“Obviously, a ton of money has been changing hands, so a thorough probe is in order to pinpoint—and haul to jail—those in and out of the government who are behind this citizenship-for-a-price racket, which has apparently been in play for years, if not decades, now,” added Villafuerte, principal author of the House-approved bill seeking to modernize the Bureau of Immigration (BI).,Villafuerte said the citizenship racket must end right away, considering that hundreds or thousands of foreigners, in apparent cahoots with unscrupulous people in the government, “have been able to enter the Philippines on the sly and then join or set up criminal gangs or POGOs that are engaged in cybercrimes, human trafficking, kidnapping and torture, among others, or even in espionage or hacking of government websites.,“That this very alarming scam has been going on for years can be gleaned from the fact that Guo and one of her siblings had reportedly managed to register as Filipinos with the PSA more than a decade after their supposed births in the Philippines,” he said.,That Guo’s case is not an isolated one can be inferred, added Villafuerte, from the fact that last weekend, two women suspected of Chinese origin were nabbed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) with passports and other government-issued IDs claiming they were Filipinos but who, upon questioning at the NAIA immigration counter, gave inconsistent statements as to where they were born or where they grew up and studied in.,Villafuerte said the authorities concerned should verify a report reaching the Senate that aliens could get fake birth certificates, passports, driver’s licenses and other government-issued IDs identifying them as Filipinos in exchange for P300,000 each.,The NBI has also uncovered a scheme used by Chinese citizens in Davao del Sur who were able to get certificates of live birth from the civil registry of Santa Cruz town over the 2018-2019 period.

‘PH playground for syndicates’,Raymond Africa,"July 17, 2024","THE Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) yesterday said the Philippines has become a “playground” for the criminal activities of syndicates who have been using illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) as their cover.,During Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means on proposals to outlaw POGOs, PAOCC chief Undersecretary Gilbert Cruz told senators that criminal syndicates have found it easy to operate in the Philippines because “illegal activities are readily available in the country.”,Cruz said syndicate members have easy access to documents to change their identities, and have “contacts” in government offices to help them elude arrest and even in courts to get favorable decisions once they are sued.,“They’re looking for a place to continue their illegal activities and they found the Philippines as their playground, because (the) things that they need to continue their illegal activities are available here,” Cruz said.,Cruz said PAOCC has raided 12 illegal POGO hubs from September 16, 2022 to June 4, 2024.,During their investigations, he said they have discovered that several fugitives, most of them Chinese nationals, have been repeatedly involved in the operation of different scams.,He said these fugitives were able to assume different identities while working in scam centers which are hiding behind legitimate offshore gaming facilities.,“They have assumed identities. They have driver’s licenses, PhilHealth cards, passports,” he said, adding: “Kaya tayo ang pinupuntahan because they can get what they want here. Naaayos pa nila kapag may problema sila sa batas. Nakuha nila ang weakness ng mga Pilipino (They come to the Philippines because they can get what they want here. They have also learned how to deal with the law. They are taking advantage of the weaknesses of Filipinos).”,Aside from fake identities and documents, Cruz said the availability of pre-registered SIM cards are also one of the reasons why fugitive foreigners have opted to stay in the country.,He said pre-registered SIM cards are a “common denominator” in the operations of illegal POGOs and other online gaming companies.,“Because there still exists pre-registered SIM Cards… They can even contact a group of creators para gumawa ng (to make) thousands of SIM cards,” he said.,Cruz said that “unless we solve these problems, hindi mawawala anf problema natin sa POGOs (our problems with illegal POGOs will not be solved).”,“Dapat maghigpit din tayo sa pag-isyu ng government IDs (We should be stricter in issuing government IDs). The Philippines is really a playground now for scamming and other illegal activities,” Cruz said.,Cruz also said criminal syndicates have decided to stop getting the services of Filipinos in their illegal activities on suspicions that their Filipino fronts tip them off to Philippine authorities.,Instead, he said, the syndicates allegedly “import” retired military and police officers from their country to spearhead their operations in the country.,Cruz did not elaborate on his statement.,It could be recalled that authorities recovered a number of Chinese military uniforms during their raid of one of the illegal POGO hubs.,Senate deputy minority leader Risa Hontiveros and Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, who is the committee chairperson, said law enforcers should conduct an intensified crackdown against groups manufacturing fake birth certificates.,In a statement, Hontiveros said: “Uncovering thousands of fake identities is a clear threat to public order and national security. Our recent legislative inquiries into POGOs have already revealed that criminal groups use fake Filipino citizenship to carry out their illicit activities.”,She said foreigners having fake Filipino identities can easily buy real estate properties, and “perhaps even have the audacity to run for public office” as what “has been done before.”,She said authorities should dig deeper into the incident in Sta. CVruz town in Davao del Sur where 1,200 foreigners, believed to be mostly Chinese, were able to obtain Filipino birth certificates through late registration.,“We must crack down on Filipinos who have made this possible,” she said.,Gatchalian said measures have to be put in place so the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) can impose stricter regulations in the issuance of birth certificates through the late registration system.,He said the fight against fake Philippine documents should be addressed through a whole of government approach to put an end to the vicious cycle.,Gatchalian, in an interview after the hearing, said almost 90 percent of the invited resource persons during yesterday’s hearing backed the proposal to ban POGOs due to the crimes associated with the industry.,“Ang pinaka-importanteng comment ay galing sa DOF. Dahil sa kanilang study walang benefit na binibigay ang POGO sa ating ekonomiya. In fact, negative pa nga because of the negative perception at masamang imahe natin (The most important comment came from the Department of Finance. Based on its study, there are no economic benefits from POGO. In fact, it is negative, because of the negative perception and the bad image it is giving to our country),” Gatchalian said.,The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation said it is against the total banning of online gaming because the government stands to lose around P40 billion annually if the proposal is passed into law.,Pagcor chairman Alejandro Tengco said: “With the trend in the first six months and with unregistered companies now coming forward and willing to register, Pagcor stands to lose… a minimum of P40 billion if this law that is being proposed will be passed.”,“In these difficult times that everyone is facing today, I believe P40 billion is a big amount if we forego of that set amount,” he added.,Tengco said Pagcor first gave a license to Phil Web to operate online gaming on March 31, 2004, but bettors have to go to a betting station to place their bets.,He said Pagcor expanded the online gaming operations after it gave Kissner Games International a license to operate mobile and wireless games on January 17, 2006.,To be able to expand its international link products, Tengco said Pagcor entered into an agreement with the Interactive Entertainment Solutions on March 30, 2009.,“So, that was when online gaming started,” he said.,Tengco said that during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, illegal online gaming proliferated, which expanded to what is called the “gray market.”,He said that to neutralize the gray market, the old Pagcor Board decided to regulate the online gaming industry by coming out with guidelines to entice online gaming companies to register.,He said that when he assumed as Pagcor chairman in August 2022, “the fi rst thing I did was look into the regulatory frameworks that were setup” due to the numerous complaints on the proliferation of illegal betting sites which duped customers.,“We saw that there were many ‘fly by night’ operators, and that being the case, the first thing that we did, to eliminate the fly by night, was to increase the financial requirements, non-refundable applications fees from P1 million to P5 million. We increased the performance deposit from then P5 million to P50 million. We then increased the capitalization from P25 million to P100 million,” Tengco said.,He said Pagcor also streamlined the application process but required the companies to “divulge the beneficial owners because most of them were lawyers and incorporators that we didn’t know.”,“Because of the regulation and strict implementation of the frameworks in place, we would have captured close to about 55 to 60 percent of the entire market. So, up to the end of 2024, I believe that there is still about anywhere between 30 to 40 percent of the business being controlled by the gray market,” he said.,He said three big companies involved in illegal online gaming operations or which were not registered prior to the implementation of the strict measures, have surfaced “and have manifested that they already want to be registered.”,“If the trend continues, we’re expecting to gain from the online gaming market about anywhere between P35 to P42 billion from license fees. And this will translate to about close to 40 percent of the current revenues of Pagcor,” he added.,In a chance interview after the hearing, Tengco said banning online gaming would only benefit the gray market.,He said the industry should instead be strictly regulated.,“Kung hindi po natin yan ire-regulate, saan po mapupunta yan kundi sa bulsa lamang ng mga nagpapatakbo… Hindi po makikinabang dyan kahit isang sentimo ang gobyerno (If we will not regulate [online gaming], revenues will only go to the pockets of those who run it…The government will not benefit even a single centavo),” he said.,If regulated, Tengco said the online gaming industry can contribute to the government in the form of taxes and licensing fees.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/ph-playground-for-syndicates/

They are all 6-foot-8, 6-foot-9, their forwards are at that height. “The guards are 6-foot-5, 6-foot-6. They are really even across the lines, so they really cause a lot of problems. Historically, they have been a really, really tough team to match up to.”,The Nationals tangle with Hong Kong three days later at the same venue, with Cone noting that playing in front of true-blue Filipino fans should bring out the best in his players.,“We are excited about playing two home games. I think that’s the thing that we are most excited about, to be able to put our team out there,” he said. “I know we played in Latvia. We played in Taiwan at home, we played Hong Kong away.

However, she encountered challenges with bogeys on Nos. 13, 15, and 17, exposing some vulnerabilities in the game of the 16-year-old Korean.,Nevertheless, Lee regained her composure and birdied the tough finishing hole to separate herself from flightmate Bisera, who had mounted her own comeback with back-to-back birdies from No. 15. The Davaoeña finished with a 74, securing her position as the main challenger in the 54-hole championship put up by ICTSI.,“I really wanted to finish at two-under today after a strong frontside 35. But unfortunately, I made several bogeys on the back nine. The greens were very challenging,” said Lee.,The change in weather also impacted her performance, differing from her experience when she won the Junior PGT Luzon Series 1 last May.,“With the rainy weather, the ground is very soft, and the greens don’t offer much roll. The course plays longer under these conditions, making it more difficult,” Lee said.,Boasting drives of 240-250 yards, Lee plans to improve in the next two rounds, emphasizing the importance of staying on the fairways to avoid the difficulties of the rough.,Marvi Monsalve, who initially led with a birdie on No. 10, stayed close to Lee despite bogeys on Nos. 16, 18 and 1.

With his mentoring, we were able to achieve our goal of capturing seven golds, including setting two new records,” said the 5-foot-10 swimmer.,Roxas shrugged off his prized ward’s claim, saying: “All we really do is to engage and guide them through our program.

"‘Bahamas files’: $15M deposits, 14 accounts, 1 Comelec official",Gerard Naval,"July 16, 2024","FORMER Caloocan Rep. Edgar Erice yesterday furnished the Commission on Elections (Comelec) what he labeled as the “Bahamas files” containing documents supposedly bearing the complete details of the foreign bank accounts of a poll official with deposits purportedly totaling $15 million from South Korea.,Speaking to reporters outside the Comelec in Intramuros, Manila, Erice said the Bahamas files purportedly contain bank account details that were sent to him by an anonymous sender.,“I received these Bahamas files that contain details of a Comelec official receiving millions of dollars from South Korea, and allegedly from Miru (Systems). It has 14 foreign accounts of a Comelec official,” said Erice.,“The documents contain the transaction records with complete details, such as who deposited, which banks received the deposits, etc.,” he added.,He said he forwarded the documents to Comelec chairman George Garcia being the head of the institution involved in the controversy.,“I gave him a copy. It’s already up to him (Garcia) how to handle these documents,” said Erice.,The ex-congressman, however, said he will also share copies of the files to senators and members of the House of Representatives, as well as Malacañang.,Asked to whom the documents came from, he said it was from an anonymous package sender from the Bahamas.,“It is from the Bahamas. It has no name of the sender,” he said.,Erice said he intends to use the same documents in pursuing graft and corrupt charges against officials of the Comelec and its Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) but admitted that its contents must “be verified first.”,“I will also file graft charges against the Comelec officials and Bids and Awards Committee before the Ombudsman,” he said.,The allegations of Erice came days after SAGIP party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta claimed that at least P120 million have been deposited to 49 offshore bank accounts from South Korean banks with all “indications leading to a Comelec official” without giving names.,Erice said he is uncertain if the Bahamas files are connected to the claims made by Marcoleta.,“I don’t know if these (bank accounts) are among them. But all these accounts were opened in 2023,” said Erice.,Sought for comment, Garcia said the supposed Bahamas files from Erice part of the elaborate “demolition job” against the poll body.,He said the same is contained in the “white paper” he got a hold of, alongside those alleged by Marcoleta.,“That’s the same information that I got. We got a copy of the white paper. More or less, it has the same content. They removed some, then added seven local banks,” said Garcia in a separate interview.,“It won’t stop. They (bank accounts) will just keep on piling up as they are on this fishing expedition,” he added.,Garcia reiterated his denial that he owns the offshore accounts, including accounts in local banks, one of which is a Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) account.,In a certification from Landbank – Intramuros Branch released by the Comelec, the government-owned bank affirmed that one of the bank accounts allegedly under Garcia’s name doesn’t exist.,“This is to certify that Personal Savings Account #7740011026173 allegedly opened on March 2022 under the name George Erwin Mojica Garcia is non-existent with Land Bank of the Philippines – Intramuros Branch considering LBP Account Number has 10-digit numbers including the branch code,” said LBP – Intramuros branch head Renato Aquino.,Habol po Metrobank…,In a separate certification, the Metrobank – Alfaro branch also said an account allegedly under the name of Garcia doesn’t exist.,According to its branch head Estrella Goureno, the certification is being issued upon the request of the poll chief himself.,“This is to certify that Mr. George Erwin Mojica Garcia with account number 1140018329104 is not a depositor of Metrobank-Alfaro branch. Account number does not exist,” said Goureno.,The poll chief said he is prepared to issue another waiver and supplemental Affidavits of Denial.,“We will again ask the National Bureau of Investigation and the Anti-Money Laundering Council to hasten their investigation. Are these real accounts? Are they mine? Were they opened by myself?” said Garcia.,Garcia also said he is now considering filing charges of falsification charges against Erice.,“This is clearly falsification. We’re no longer considering libel cases. We are thinking of falsification of a public or even a private document. It has a longer penal provision,” he said.,“More importantly, it has a provision that says whoever holds the falsified document is presumed by law as the author of the falsified document. The law has a presumption. It is necessary to prove that those aren’t falsified documents,” Garcia added.,Marcoleta said Garcia was just bluffing when he vowed to execute a waiver to allow the NBI to look into his bank accounts because Philippine agencies are powerless in foreign jurisdictions.,Marcoleta, who earlier said a Comelec official’s offshore accounts received deposits of at least P120 million from Korean banks between June 2023 and March 2024, said he has been anticipating Garcia’s next moves which are meant “to appear innocent.”,“According to Republic Act (RA) 1405, or the Bank Secrecy Act, a valid waiver only applies to banks operating in the Philippines. In the case of offshore bank accounts, a court order is required to compel a foreign jurisdiction to look into suspicious transactions,” Marcoleta said in a statement.,He said any inquiry or investigation into the accounts in foreign banks that are beyond Philippine jurisdiction or any transaction made in regard to such accounts “must require the involvement of their foreign governments, and shall be subject to the respective bank secrecy laws of such foreign jurisdictions.” ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/bahamas-files-15m-deposits-14-accounts-1-comelec-official/

So, that will lift the warrant [of arrest]. That’s it, although I cannot influence her decision, [she has reasons not to attend] since she was traumatized, she was threatened. I can only give her legal advice,” he added.,David said Guo wants to attend the hearings but fears for her safety.,“Sabi ko kung sa Senate lang naman ‘yan, gagarantiyahan ko naman ang safety doon. Mas safe ka pa nga diyan kung tutuusin (I told her that I can guarantee her safety in the Senate. I said she is safer in the Senate [that any other place]),” he added.,Senate President Francis Escudero yesterday said he would guarantee the safety of Guo and the other resource persons once they are detained in the Senate.,Escudero said that Guo and the rest could be detained at the PNP station inside the Senate compound if they were arrested.,He said the PNP facility is airconditioned and should be a perfect detention site for Guo and the rest since the police will serve as their guards.,Escudero said he has ordered the Office of the Senate Sergeant-At-Arms to review the guidelines for detaining resource persons since he sees no reason why detainees should not be allowed to have their electronic gadgets while detained.,“I see no reason why we should not allow them [to have gadgets]. They are not drug lords who can continue with their trade while in detention. Second, I don’t see a dangerous incident where they can escape from detention. So, I ordered a review, we will find out,” Escudero said.,He said the detention of Guo is not a punishment but rather an assurance that she will attend the Senate probe.,The Senate has issued warrants of arrest against Guo, her siblings –Shiela, Sieman, and Wesley; father Jian Zhong Guo; suspected mother Lin Wen Yi; Nancy Gamo, the family’s accountant; and Dennis Cunanan, a former Technology and Livelihood Resource Center director who has been slapped a 26-year jail term for his involvement in the pork barrel scam.,The Office of the Senate Sergeant-At-Arms has dispatched its personnel to arrest Guo and the rest but only Gamo was arrested last Saturday. The others were not in their known addresses.,Lawyer Iryl Boco said Cunanan, who is their client, is willing to attend the next hearing on July 29 but has yet to receive a copy of the arrest warrant.,Boco said they have no idea if Cunanan would voluntarily give himself up and have himself detained at the Senate before the next hearing.,Senate president pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada said government agencies that have police powers should step up the hunt for Guo, adding the mayor and the rest should surrender “unless they have left the country.”,Hontiveros said the warrants of arrest issued against Guo and the rest are not merely “procedural” and “uphold the mandate of the Senate to safeguard the well-being of Filipinos.”,She called on Guo to surrender, saying: “Mayor Alice Guo or Guo Hua Ping, if you are able to go online on Facebook, maybe you can also appear in the Senate. You even used Facebook to spread lies that you are a Filipino. You are not a Filipino since there is strong evidence already presented.”,Hontiveros said that investigations conducted by the Anti-Money Laundering Council showed that Baofu Land Development Inc., where Guo has interests, has direct connections with Yu Zheng Can, an incorporator of Hong Sheng Gaming Technology Inc., the operator of the POGO hub raided in Bamban, Tarlac in February 2023, and Hongjiang Yang, who she said is the brother of Michael Yang, the economic adviser of former President Duterte.,“In short, the money of Michael Yang’s brother was used to fund Hong Sheng, the raided Bamban POGO.”,She said Hongjiang is an incorporator of the Full Win Group of Companies, where Gerald Cruz is an incorporator of Pharmally Biological.  She said Cruz is the same individual who is an incorporator of the Brickhartz POGO hub whose documents were found in the Bamban POGO facility.,“Sabi ko nga, mukhang one big, happy Pharmally pala itong mga POGO at Pharmally members…Our Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality will continue to dig deeper.

But I can say 100 percent she is in the Philippines. That was what she told me.”,David said Guo is the subject of an immigration lookout bulletin order issued by the Department of Justice to the Bureau of Immigration, adding authorities have also tightened their monitoring in the country’s airports and seaports because of the issuance.,The ILBO differs from a precautionary hold departure order since it is for monitoring purposes only and is not a sufficient prohibition to bar someone from leaving the country.,Only the courts can issue a PHDO.,The Senate is investigating Guo’s alleged links to an illegal POGO facility in Bamban raided by the authorities last March.,She has been unmasked as a Chinese masquerading as a Filipino by the National Bureau of Investigation.,Charges of human trafficking have been lodged against her before the DOJ while the Office of the Solicitor General had asked a Tarlac court to nullify her certificate of live birth.,Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said this is aside from the quo warranto petition they will file against the suspended mayor soon.,Former chief presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo said Hontiveros is bent on “maligning the character” and “tarnishing the image” of former President Rodrigo Duterte to get media mileage and increase her name recall in anticipation of a possible run for higher office in the future.,Panelo said Hontiveros “is desperately bent on connecting the former President to the controversial pharmacy anomaly which is under investigation in the Office of the Ombudsman” when there is “absolutely” no factual and legal basis to link Duterte to any corrupt practice.,He said the former President has never been involved in any form of corruption and is in fact known as a “fierce and unforgiving nemesis of grafters and enemies of the state.”,“Her (Hontiveros) obsession to tarnish the reputation of PRRD is insatiable,” he said, adding the senator is using her position as senator and chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality to try persons by publicity and without due process.,He said this is what is happening to Pastor Apollo Quiboloy and Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo, “who have become victims of her injustice.”,“She has been abusing this right given to Congress. Her apparent intention is to malign the character of PRRD and at the same time, she wants to be politically relevant and preparing to run for a higher office. She always wants to be in the public eye for the name recall and media mileage,” Panelo said.,He said Hontiveros should just focus on introducing legislative bills that will address the basic problems of the country like poverty, lack of education, and issues on health, public works, agriculture, trade and the like “instead of nauseous grandstanding.” ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/guo-considering-attending-next-senate-hearing/

Nolasco, Jesus Madamo, Meriro Poquito, Maricel Amdagkit, Marriance Aga, Marcial Rendon, Jenevive Paraba, Nerfa Awing, Wingwing Daunsay, Nerhaya Talledo, and Ma. Concepcion Ibarra,” the court’s decision read.,“Records reveal that the prosecution has established proof beyond reasonable doubt that accused Ocampo, Castro, Nolasco, Madamo, Poquito, Andagkit, Aga, Rendon, Paraba, Awing, Daunsay, Talledo and Ibarra, indeed committed acts detrimental to the safety and well-being of the minor Lumad learners by keeping them in their company and transporting them on foot in the evening for three hours, more or less, on a dark, remote and unsecured road without the assistance and presence of the law enforcement, any government agency, or written permission and consent of the minor’s parents and exposing said minors to dangers and hazards by traveling in the middle of the night, thereby compromising their safety, and creating conditions prejudicial to their development,” it added.,In the same ruling, the court junked the same charges against four pastors namely Edgar Ugal, Ryan Magpayo, Eller Ordeniza and Jurie Jaime as the prosecution has “failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.”,The 14 minor in the solidarity mission were students of the Salugpungan Ta Tanu Ingkanuhan Community Learning Center Inc.,Castro and Ocampo’s group, joined by over 70 others, was conducting the National Solidarity Mission in Talaingod town to provide assistance to Lumad schools and investigate cases of alleged human rights violations perpetrated by the paramilitary group Alamara.,The paramilitary group was earlier blamed for forcibly closing the Salugpongan Lumad school.,Castro and Ocampo’s group, with the minors, was intercepted at a police and military checkpoint in coordination with the local social welfare and development office in Barangay Sto. Niño, Talaingod town on the night of Nov. 28, 2018.,The prosecution said the group “failed to present or show” any legal documents authorizing them to bring or transport the minors.,In finding the respondents guilty for violating RA 7610, the court said the prosecution was able to show that they took the minor Lumads out in the dark and on an unsecured road and let them walk on foot for three hours, in an area known to be dangerous being the site of previous encounters between the Philippine Army and the communist New People’s Army, which it said endangered them.,The court also said the minors could have been bitten by snakes or insects, could have fallen into a ravine or a off cliff, or slipped on the road.,“As a result thereof, the minor children were undoubtedly endangered which created the conditions prejudicial to their development,” the court said.,The court likewise said the respondents had no valid justification or authority to take the 14 minors.,“In addition, the act of the accused clearly show that they failed to take necessary precaution to safeguard the safety and well-being of the children when they transported the Lumad learners from Sitio Dulyan to Tagum City,” the court added.,The court added that the accused “acted in conspiracy with one another” when they transported the 14 students “except the four pastors.”,“In arriving at such ruling, this Court is convinced that the prosecution has sufficiently proven without any iota of doubt that there was indeed conspiracy between and among the principals, namely Ocampo, Castro and Nolasco,” the court said, adding the prosecution was able to present evidence that the national solidarity mission was planned in advance.,Castro and Ocampo, in the joint statement, said they “remain steadfast in our support for the indigenous schools and communities who continue to bear the brunt of the fascist attacks by the Marcos regime.”,“The persons who are actually responsible for the forcible closure of the schools as well as the threats and harassment have never been investigated. This is a clear miscarriage of justice, and we will strongly question this decision in all venues possible,” they also said.,In a separate statement, Castro the effect of the court’s decision “is that rescuing children from military intimidation and harassment is wrong and the children would have to go through bureaucratic documentation before they can be rescued in an emergency crisis.”,“We will appeal this decision even if it reaches the Supreme Court, As it is, we will continue to work for the reopening of Lumad schools for them to be more informed and prepared for the future,” said the educator-turned-lawmaker.,Rep. Arlene Brosas (PL, Gabriela), Castro’s fellow Makabayan bloc member, said the “Talaingod 18” are victims of state persecution for their humanitarian efforts to rescue Lumad students and teachers from threats and harassment.,“The circumstances of their arrest and detention in 2018 were marked by irregularities and clear violations of their rights. This conviction is a blatant attack on those who stand in solidarity with indigenous communities and their right to education,” she said.,Brosas also said it is alarming that while activists and educators face “unjust” convictions, those responsible for the forcible closure of schools and threats against the Lumad community remain uninvestigated.,“We demand accountability from former President Rodrigo Duterte and the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) for endangering the lives of indigenous children. We stand in solidarity with the Talaingod 18 and all victims of political persecution and call for the dropping of all trumped-up charges,” she said.,Rep. Raoul Manuel (PL, Kabataan), also of the Makabayan bloc, said Castro’s conviction seems to be linked to her roles in leading the charge to hold accountable former president Rodrigo Duterte for his bloody war on drugs, Vice President Sara Duterte for her use of confidential funds and their ally pastor Apollo Quiboloy “for being an internationally wanted child sex trafficker.”,“This is sweet revenge for them. It would not be surprising if they had a hand in this. This is a political maneuver to pre-empt the 2025 bid of genuine opposition leaders with Rep. Castro at the helm,” Manuel said. “We call to junk the trumped up charges against Rep. France, Ka Satur, and the volunteer teachers of Lumad Schools. It should be the real child abusers currently running free, like those in the ranks of the military and Quiboloy whom Rodrigo Duterte fiercely protects, that should be jailed.”,The Communist Party of the Philippines described the court decision as a “direct attack of the fascist US-Marcos regime against the democratic and patriotic forces of the Filipino people.”,“We join the broad masses of the Filipino people in roundly condemning this grave act of political persecution,” CPP spokesman Marco Valbuena said in a statement.,Valbuena said it is a “gross political and historical distortion” that Castro, Ocampo and the others “are being painted as criminals for rescuing and providing safe haven for Lumad Manobo children” who he said were subjected to military “attacks.”,Amid plans by leftist groups to hold indignation rallies, the NTF-ELCAC’s Torres,
urged Castro’s camp to respect the court’s decision.,“Satur and Castro were given their day in court. They were assisted by a battalion of lawyers and their case was found wanting. They should accept the court’s decision because we are a nation of laws and not of men,” he said.,National Security Adviser Eduardo Año, who is also vice chairman of the NTF-ELCAC, said the court decision “shows that no one is above the law.”,“It doesn’t matter if you are prominent in society, the law is the law and one has to be accountable for one’s actions,” he said.,Año also commended the Department of Justice, the Office of the Solicitor General, the NTF-ELCAC, the PNP and the Armed Forces “for their vigilant efforts in ensuring that justice is served.”,Torres commended government prosecutors and lawyers from the NTF-ELCAC who he said worked tirelessly to win the case.,He urged the public to maintain vigilance and continue supporting indigenous communities.

WHO fails to catch up with consumer-led innovation to end smoking,...,"July 17, 2024","THE World Health Organization (WHO) and other anti-vaping groups have failed to catch up with consumer-driven public health innovations, particularly smoke-free technologies that are now helping millions of smokers quit, according to tobacco harm reduction (THR) advocates.,Prof. David Sweanor, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa in Canada who has a 40-year career in tobacco control and law, said the debate on THR is often clouded by assumptions about unknown risks from new technologies.,“This has often amplified the levels that overshadow the dangers of known risks. This is what we’ve always dealt with, with innovation,” Swearnor said during the recent Global Forum on Nicotine in Warsaw, Poland.,“I think the fact that we’re seeing so much progress, that consumers themselves are moving, that the politicians are going to have to follow that. Because otherwise all they do is lose credibility. That’s now happening with WHO.”,He said consumers are leading the shift, seeking out and experiencing the benefits of safer alternatives to cigarettes, such as vapes, heated tobacco, and oral nicotine pouches.,“Anti-nicotine groups often rely on sloganeering instead of data,” he said. “They prioritize abstinence-only approaches, potentially sacrificing the health of millions of smokers who could switch to safer options.”,The market for cigarette alternatives has grown into a $350-billion global industry, according to Harry Shapiro, executive editor of the Global State of Tobacco Harm Reduction report. “Over 120 million people worldwide, mainly in high-income countries, now use safer nicotine products,” he said.,Sweanor compared the rapid change in the nicotine industry to the rise of mobile phones. He underscored the need for regulations that acknowledge both innovation and potential risks.,“Even with all the obstructions, consumers are moving to these products. Even in countries that have tried to ban them and ban them harder. These products are still reducing cigarette smoking. So we’re seeing consumers move. The market’s moving,” he said. “It’s unstoppable. You’re not going to stop innovation.”,Sweanor criticized anti-vaping groups for prioritizing slogans over data. “They’re saying all we’re concerned about is young people, meaning you’re willing to write off hundreds of millions of adults,” he said. “How many of those young people are now going to smoke cigarettes instead of vaping? How many of them are going to get sick and die because of that?”,Millions of consumers, however, are switching to safer nicotine products despite the scare tactics of these groups.,“An extraordinary number of people do learn that nicotine isn’t what’s causing the problem,” Sweanor said.,These new technologies offer less harmful alternatives that could prevent millions of annual deaths by eliminating smoke-related toxins. Mounting scientific evidence from reputable public health institutions concludes that nicotine is not the culprit in smoking-related diseases. Burning tobacco produces thousands of toxic chemicals, causing cancer and other deadly diseases.,The UK’s Office for Health Improvement and Disparities determined vaping is 95 percent less harmful than smoking., ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/who-fails-to-catch-up-with-consumer-led-innovation-to-end-smoking/
5 DepEd executives quit,Ashzel Hachero,"July 17, 2024","FIVE high-ranking officials of the Department of Education, including Undersecretary and spokesperson Michael Poa, resigned almost a month after Vice President Sara Duterte quit as Education chief last June.,“I think it is only appropriate to give the incoming Secretary of Education, Secretary Sonny Angara, a free hand to choose the people that will form part of his team,” Poa said in a Viber message.,Angara said “we respect” the decision of department officials “who tendered their courtesy resignations ahead of our assumption” as agency head.,“We eagerly anticipate taking on our new role this Friday. Any appropriate appointments will be announced soon as we intend to hit the ground running and drive immediate progress,” Angara said.,President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. named Angara to head the DepEd last July 2.,Asked if he would still work with Duterte in the Office of the Vice President, Poa said: “I will just wait for instructions from the Vice President, if any.”,Before his appointment to the DepEd, Poa served as chief of staff of the Government Service Insurance System and a member of its editorial board from 2011 to 2013.,Aside from Poa, DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Nolasco Mempin, Assistant Secretary for Procurement Reynold Munsayac, Assistant Secretary for Administration Noel Baluyan and Assistant Secretary-Office of the Secretary Sunshine Fajarda also tendered their resignations.,Mempin and Baluyan are retired military officers.,Mempin was a former commander of the Army’s 10th Infantry Division based in Mawab, Compostela Valley (now Davao de Oro) and head of Task Force Davao when Sara Duterte served as mayor of Davao City.,Baluyan was the assistant division commander of the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division based in Jamindan, Capiz before he retired in 2022. , ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/5-deped-executives-quit/

"North Korean diplomat defected to South Korea from Cuba, reports say",...,"July 17, 2024","SEOUL — A senior North Korean diplomat based in Cuba defected with his wife and child to South Korea in November, South Korean media reports said on Tuesday, becoming the highest-ranking North Korean diplomat to escape to the South since 2016.,Before fleeing to the South, Ri Il Kyu, 52, told South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo he was a counsellor at the North Korean embassy in Cuba. Yonhap News Agency also reported Ri had defected to the South, citing an anonymous government source.,The South’s unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, declined to comment on the reports, citing privacy issues.,Among Ri’s jobs at the embassy was to block North Korea’s rival South Korea and old ally Cuba from forging diplomatic ties, Chosun Ilbo reported. In February, the two countries established diplomatic relations.,Ri said he flew out of Cuba with his family but he did not elaborate further on how he pulled off the high-risk escape.,“I bought flight tickets and called my wife and kid to tell them about my decision, six hours before the defection. I didn’t say South Korea, but said, let’s live abroad,” he said.,North Koreans caught attempting to defect face severe punishment, including death, according to human rights groups and defectors who have been successful.,Fewer North Korean defectors have been arriving in South Korea in recent years due to strict limits on border crossings into China and hefty broker fees, human rights groups and experts say.,Last year, 196 North Korean defectors came to Seoul, down from as many as 2,700 a decade ago, South Korean government data showed. Most of those North Korean defectors who recently defected to the South have long lived overseas, like the diplomat Ri, human rights activists say.,Details on North Koreans defections often take months to come to light, with defectors needing to be cleared by authorities and going through a course of education about South Korean society and systems.,DISILLUSIONMENT,Ri entered North Korea’s foreign ministry in 1999 and received a commendation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for successfully negotiating with Panama to lift the detention of a North Korean ship caught carrying arms from Cuba in 2013, Chosun said.,He told the newspaper he had decided to defect over disillusionment with the regime and unfair evaluation of his work.,Ri said he made a final decision to run when his request to travel to Mexico for a medical treatment was denied last year, adding that his parents and parents-in-law who might face reprisals for his defection had passed away.,The last such known high-profile defection to the South was that of Tae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom, in 2016.,“I hope that all former North Korean diplomats will join forces and work hard for the unification movement to realize the dream of North Korean officials and people to have their children live freely in South Korea,” Tae said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.,“Welcome, Counsellor Ilkyu!” said Tae, adding that Ri was a former rival in table tennis games at the foreign ministry.,South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday promised better financial support for North Korean defectors and tax incentives for companies hiring those defectors, as he attended the ceremony for the inaugural North Korean Defectors’ Day.,North Korea last year shut some embassies in an effort to “rearrange its diplomatic capacity efficiently”, closures that South Korea says indicates the North is struggling under the burden of sanctions.,North Korea maintains an embassy in Cuba, though its ambassador returned home in March, according to media reports. ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/north-korean-diplomat-defected-to-south-korea-from-cuba-reports-say/
"Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 17, Palestinian health officials say",...,"July 17, 2024","CAIRO/GAZA — Israeli forces battled Hamas-led fighters in several parts of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, and Palestinian health officials said at least 17 people were killed in Israeli bombardments of southern and central areas.,The Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas has accused Israel of stepping up attacks in Gaza to try to derail efforts by Arab mediators and the United States to reach a ceasefire deal. Israel says it is trying to root out Hamas fighters.,In Rafah, a southern border city where Israeli forces have been operating since May, five Palestinians were killed in an airstrike on a house. In nearby Khan Younis, a man, his wife and two children were killed, they said.,In the historic Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, at least four Palestinians were killed in separate shelling and aerial strikes in central Gaza, medics said. An Israeli airstrike killed four in Sheikh Zayed in northern Gaza, they said.,The Israeli military said troops continued “intelligence-based” activities in Rafah, and that airstrikes had targeted militants, tunnels, and other Hamas military infrastructure.,It said the Israeli air force had struck around 40 targets across the enclave, including sniping and observation posts, military structures, and buildings rigged with explosives.,The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally, said their fighters had attacked Israeli forces in several locations with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.,Islamic Jihad’s armed wing said it had fired missiles at Sderot in southern Israel. There was no word of any deaths or serious damage.,Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas after its militants killed 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage in an attack on southern Israeli communities last Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies.,More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory offensive, according to health authorities in Gaza, much of which has been devastated.

"After Trump shooting, his supporters still fiercely oppose gun reforms",...,"July 17, 2024","MILWAUKEE — Their presidential candidate had just narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, a bullet grazing his ear on Saturday from an AR-15-style semiautomatic weapon – a rifle frequently used by mass shooters in the United States.,Yet in interviews with 12 Donald Trump delegates at his Republican Party nominating convention in Milwaukee, none advocated for limits or bans on assault rifles, raising the legal age to buy a gun, or even more robust background checks.,The delegates were dead set against any type of reform to America’s gun laws.,Most viewed even mild measures, such as expanded background checks, or raising the legal age to buy an assault weapon to 21, as infringements on the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment, which grants citizens the right to own guns.,Instead, the delegates said any gun-related reforms should focus on funding better mental health support for troubled citizens, a standard Republican position. They blamed gun crime and gun massacres – including the assassination attempt on Trump – largely on mental illness and weapons falling into the wrong hands.,U.S. law enforcement officials are still trying to determine why Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old nursing home aide, shot at Trump at his election rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Crooks was shot dead in the attack, which the FBI said was being investigated as potential domestic terrorism.,More effective mental health services are the key to spotting potential shooters and getting them help before they carry out a gun crime, the delegates interviewed said.,“It’s all about mental health,” said Will Boone, a delegate from Montana. “The right to have a gun is enshrined in the Constitution. Once you start infringing on that, you’ll start other rights being taken away.”,Steve Kramer, from Georgia, said it was a “lie” that expanded background checks would help.,“If you look at most of the killings, someone stole the gun, so background checks wouldn’t matter,” Kramer said.,Between 1966 and 2019, apart from school shooters who mainly stole their weapons from family members, most people who committed mass shooting had bought their weapons legally, according to data compiled by the National Institute of Justice, a research agency of the Department of Justice.,The weapon used by Trump’s would-be assassin was owned by his father, according to investigators.,The Republican Party has generally blocked attempts to reform gun laws, even after the massacre of 20 elementary school children in Connecticut in 2012 by a gunman armed with an AR-15 assault-type weapon and two handguns.,Efforts to pass universal background checks and an assault weapons ban were defeated by Republicans in the U.S. Senate after that school massacre.,During his 2017-2021 term, Trump tried several times to loosen gun laws, said Kris Brown, president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence.,Shortly after taking office he signed into law a bill that reversed an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illness to purchase guns.,The Trump administration did ban bump stocks, an accessory that essentially converts a semi-automatic weapon into a machine gun. A bump stock was used in America’s deadliest mass shooting, in Las Vegas in 2017, when a gunman killed 60 and wounded more than 400 people.,In June, the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on bump stocks.,In February, speaking to the National Rifle Association, Trump pledged to undo all gun-related restrictions enacted by Democratic President Joe Biden, whom he faces in the Nov. 5 election.,Matthew Rust, a delegate from Wisconsin, said he believed an armed citizenry is a deterrent to shooters. “When a perpetrator knows there may be law-abiding citizens that can defend themselves they are less likely to take action,” Rust said. ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/after-trump-shooting-his-supporters-still-fiercely-oppose-gun-reforms/
"Trump picks onetime critic J.D. Vance, now a fierce defender, as his running mate",...,"July 17, 2024","MILWAUKEE — Republican Donald Trump selected J.D. Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio and author of the bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” as his running mate on Monday, elevating a politician who once criticized the former president in acid terms but has since become one of his most stalwart defenders.,The news, the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, emerged at the start of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to nominate the party’s presidential ticket. Soon after, Vance appeared at the event to the applause of party delegates but did not give any remarks.,“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media website.,The selection of James David Vance could help boost turnout for Trump in the Nov. 5 election, particularly in some of the “Rust Belt” states where the election will likely be decided. The Ohio native is deeply popular with the Republican candidate’s base, and his populist message is well-suited for states that have significant working-class white populations and have suffered from de-industrialization.,A staunch conservative, Vance is unlikely to bring many new voters into Trump’s corner, however, and may even alienate some moderates. Some of Trump’s supporters had pushed him to select a woman or person of color as his No. 2 to expand a coalition that skews toward white men.,Several advisers to Trump said the former president, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, had focused on choosing a running mate he trusted and got along with.,Among those who had privately advocated for Vance, according to several sources familiar with the matter, were Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.,Though several donors told Reuters they were disappointed by the pick, another donor, oil businessman Dan Eberhart, saw the choice as a sign of Trump’s confidence in his campaign against President Joe Biden. Polls show the men locked in a tight race nationally, but Trump has a measurable lead in most of the battleground states that will decide the election.,“It demonstrates that Trump doesn’t feel he needs his VP to deliver any specific demographic or state,” Eberhart said. “He’s confident that he has this race wrapped up.”,In selecting Vance, Trump passed over other contenders, including U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.,At 39, Vance represents a younger generation in an election that features Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, bringing a counterweight to the Democratic ticket that also includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59.,Vance’s rapid ascent has been unusual for American politics. After an impoverished childhood in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, won a scholarship to Yale Law School and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.,He rose to prominence after 2016 when he wrote “Hillbilly Elegy,” in which he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown.,The book criticized what Vance saw as a self-destructive culture in rural America and sought to explain Trump’s popularity among poor white Americans.,Vance himself was harshly critical of Trump before and after Trump’s 2016 election win against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, calling him an “idiot” and “America’s Hitler,” among other epithets.,But as Vance geared up to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 2022, he transformed into one of the former president’s most consistent defenders, supporting Trump even when some Senate colleagues declined to do so.,Vance has played down the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and he has echoed Trump’s criticisms of the way the U.S. Justice Department has prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters, accusing the department of disregarding due process protections.,While the Republican Party historically stood for free markets and embraced foreign intervention as an important national security tool, Trump’s 2016 election opened up significant rifts within the party. Vance has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a stance at odds with many Republican legislative leaders.,On the campaign trail, the former venture capitalist has also served as a bridge between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have opened their wallets to Trump this election.,FRAUGHT SELECTION PROCESS,Vance’s anti-corporate rhetoric and his opposition to Ukraine aid gave some donors pause, and four donors told Reuters in the moments after the selection that they felt let down. Many contributors to the campaign were hoping for a business-friendly nominee who would expand the electoral map.,“Of all the choices he had, I think he chose the worst one,” said donor and metals businessman Andy Sabin, who had been waiting for Trump’s pick for running mate to see whether he would donate to the campaign.,“Vance is going to hurt Trump more than help him,” Sabin said, citing Vance’s Ukraine stance. “Now I definitely won’t donate.”,At least some senior campaign advisers were partial to Rubio, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Rubio has significant political experience and might have helped boost the former president’s support among Latinos.,Trump’s vice presidential selection process was drawn out and calibrated for maximum suspense.,While the former president started with an informal long list of at least a dozen people, he had whittled down his options over the course of 2024, with Vance, Burgum and Rubio emerging as the most serious contenders. Mike Pence, who twice served as Trump’s running mate, declined to endorse his former boss in this year’s election.,Many of Trump’s closest advisers did not know until Monday who the former president would pick.,Biden told reporters on Monday that Vance was a “clone” of Trump when it comes to policy issues. The Democratic president’s campaign, in a separate call with reporters, criticized Vance for his record advocating against abortion rights.,While Vance recently said he opposed federal restrictions on the use of abortion pills, a position Trump shares, he has frequently expressed support for abortion restrictions in the past. In a 2021 interview, for instance, he implied that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term. ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/trump-picks-onetime-critic-j-d-vance-now-a-fierce-defender-as-his-running-mate/
"Biden to be Democratic nominee in weeks  with virtual vote, despite turmoil",Reuters,"July 17, 2024","PRESIDENT Joe Biden is on track to receive the official 2024 presidential nomination from fellow Democrats for a second term in a virtual vote as planned in late July ahead of the party’s national convention, despite calls for him to step aside, four people involved in the process told Reuters.,Democrats and Republicans typically use their national conventions to officially nominate their candidates, but Biden will be nominated weeks before his party gathers for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19 – a plan that was announced long before Biden’s shaky June 27 debate.,Exactly how the early process will work is unclear, however, said the state party officials and national Democrats interviewed for this story.,Biden, 81, is under continued pressure and scrutiny from some lawmakers, donors and activists to drop his reelection campaign in the wake of his disastrous presidential debate performance, which renewed questions about his mental fitness.,Biden campaign officials said they expect that Saturday’s assassination attempt on Republican rival Donald Trump will lower the pressure on Biden to step aside.,Biden has repeatedly insisted he is not going anywhere and says he is best equipped to beat Trump.,Pushing forward with what senior Democrats have described as a “virtual roll call” could speed up Biden’s nomination and stave off potential challengers to his candidacy. But confusion surrounding the virtual process reflects the chaos within the party, as senior leaders focus on salvaging Biden’s candidacy, sources said.,There does not appear to be any well-defined push to rally delegates around any other candidate ahead of the virtual vote.,The early nomination was needed to deal with an Ohio law that could have kept Biden’s name off ballots in the state if he wasn’t nominated by Aug. 7, prior to the convention in Chicago.,Democrats are still moving forward with the plan even though Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill in May to secure Biden’s spot on the state’s ballot after it passed the Republican-controlled state legislature.,An online or virtual vote means no chance of a live convention floor battle in Chicago that could embarrass Biden and throw the campaign into chaos.,Many of the details will be determined on July 19 and 21 when the party’s convention rules and credentials committee meet, respectively.,Any virtual nomination process is likely to happen within days of those meetings, officials said.,Some officials with the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign said they expect something similar to 2020 when the COVID pandemic forced the party to hold a virtual roll call that featured state officials backing Biden against the video backdrop of American landscapes.,Others said the early nomination process will be much less dramatic, with delegates filling out online voting forms.,Either way, Democrats plan to do a traditional roll call at the August convention with a mix of pre-recorded messages and live action, even though the formal nomination will have already taken place.,In 2024, there will be an estimated 4,532 delegates at the Democratic convention, including 3,788 pledged delegates and 744 “automatic” delegates — more commonly known as superdelegates.,To win the Democratic nomination, a presidential candidate needs to receive the support of a majority — or roughly 1,895 — of the pledged delegates in the first roll call. If not, the superdelegates – who are free to vote for whoever they like – will join and help decide in the second roll call.,During the party’s primary election, where Biden faced no serious opposition, he secured the support of some 3,900 delegates, significantly more than needed.,Pledged delegates are expected to support Biden but there are differing opinions on whether they are bound to support him.,Democratic National Committee (DNC) officials have been making calls to delegates to take their temperature in recent days to identify any potential problems, officials told Reuters.,The delegates are expected to be given three options: support Biden, uncommitted or leave blank, according to party officials. All the delegates Reuters spoke to said they plan to support Biden.,On Thursday, Biden was asked about concerns that delegates will defect.,“Obviously they’re free to do whatever they want, but they — I get overwhelming support,” Biden said. “It’s not going to happen.”,If Biden steps down after the official nomination, the 435 members of the DNC would choose a new candidate, in a special session.,The members are divided roughly equally between men and women as well as various constituency groups including labor leaders, LGBTQ representatives, and racial minorities.,Of the total, 75 are appointed at-large by the chair, while the rest are elected in their respective states.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/biden-to-be-democratic-nominee-in-weeks-with-virtual-vote-despite-turmoil/
Caloocan solon sued for graft  over P8M ‘pork barrel’ release,Peter Tabingo,"July 17, 2024","FORMER Caloocan City mayor Reynaldo Malonzo yesterday filed criminal complaints before the Office of the Ombudsman against Caloocan City Rep. Oscar Malapitan and six co-respondents in connection to alleged anomalous releases of the lawmaker’s Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) allocations amounting to P8 million from 2007 to 2009.,Also named in the complaint were former Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Esperanza Cabral, former undersecretary Mateo Montaño, assistant secretary Vilma Cabrera, DSWD Program Management Bureau director Pacita Sarino, chief accountant Leonila Hayahay, and private respondent Cenon Mayor, president of the Kaloocan Assistance Council Inc. (KACI), a non-government organization (NGO).,Malonzo accused them of multiple violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019) and malversation of public funds.,The complainant said the respondents were responsible for the transfer of Malapitan’s PDAF to KACI even if the NGO was not eligible to receive public funds, noting that it was “not a licensed and accredited PO” (people’s organization).,He pointed out that based on the 2022 audit of the DSWD, the amounts released to KACI remain unliquidated.,Malapitan was accused of favoring the NGO “by endorsing and personally identifying KACI” to implement his PDAF-funded projects.,“Respondent Malapitan, a public officer who had control of his PDAF funds, which were public funds, misappropriated or consented or, through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take them,” Malonzo said.,On the other hand, he charged Cabral and the other DSWD executives with conspiracy to illegally transfer public funds to KACI even if had unliquidated cash advances dating back to 2006 and 2007., ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/caloocan-solon-sued-for-graft-over-p8m-pork-barrel-release/
Picks out to bolster Painters,Michael Jugado,"July 17, 2024","RAIN or Shine got a pleasant surprise when Fil-Am forward Caelan Tiongson was still available when the Elasto Painters took their turn at No. 7 in the PBA 49th season rookie Draft last Sunday.,After choosing Tiongson, Rain or Shine pulled off a stunner when it tabbed relatively unknown playmaker Felix Lemetti at No. 8.,Coach Yeng Guiao said the decision to select the 6-foot-5 Tiongson should serve the Painters in good stead.,“Masaya kami, inabutan pa namin si Caelan. Akala namin he will be drafted earlier, although we had our contingencies already,” Guiao said.,“We’re expecting him to be a leader since he’s been a veteran for some years playing around the world,” he added.,Tiongson, 32, suited up for Chong Son Kung Fu and Alab Pilipinas in the ABL before retiring in 2019.,He returned two years later and linked up with the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League in Taiwan.,Guiao said Tiongson is expected to provide the leadership savvy along with old reliables Beau Belga and Gabe Norwood.,“With Caelan, we have another leader on our team,” Guiao said. “We know his abilities. We know that he’s someone who can score, who can defend.,“We also know that he’s got leadership abilities. Those will be useful for a young team like ours.”,Guiao said the Fil-Swedish Lemetti will be a big boost to his charges’ backcourt arsenal.,“Si Felix Lemetti, we felt that he had potential. Noong nakita namin siya sa practice, sabi namin, baka puwedeng magamit sa team,” Guiao said, who also drafted the likes of Francis Escandor, Mike Malonzo and Miggy Corteza in the second round.,“He’s a true point guard, solid point guard. He can score. At the same time, he can command iyong team. We’re looking for somebody like that.”,The 6-foot-1 Lemetti, 25, had stops with four different schools in the United States but his most noteworthy stint was with the NCAA Division I squad Omaha Mavericks where he averaged 7.1 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists.,Guiao is convinced Lemetti has what it takes., ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_sports/picks-out-to-bolster-painters/

Matthew Manotoc, whose province has been awarded the right to host the 2025 Palarong Pambansa, has acknowledged that Cebu City would be a hard act to follow.,“Cebu City is very experienced in hosting events so hopefully we can match and keep up the standard set by Cebu City,” Manotoc said last Monday in an impromptu press conference on the eve of the meet’s closing rites Tuesday.,Manotoc will be given the Palaro colors during the turnover segment of the closing rites where Vice President Sara Duterte, who skipped last week’s opening graced by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., is scheduled to attend.,The nephew of the Chief Executive’s son was impressed by what Cebu City has done after visiting some of the competition venues, adding that he brought his IT and media chiefs to do a benchmarking of what the host did.,“Obviously, ours will be not the same but we will make sure everyone is comfortable and complies with sporting standard when we host it. With the help of DepEd and the private sector, we hope to host a successful Palaro,” the governor said.,“It will be a different Palaro in terms of size and infrastructure and but we will be able to do it in our own way to ensure that the standards are met in staging the meet,” he stressed.,The main hub of activity, he said, will be the President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Stadium and the adjacent Olympic-size swimming pool in Laoag City where his uncle, Michael Keon, is the mayor.,“Everything is on track and the President Marcos Stadium will be our main hub in Laoag City with one or two neighboring cities helping to host the event,” he said.,Hosting the national meet for student athletes, Manotoc said, is part of their bid to make the province a major sports tourism hub in Northern Luzon.,“We always say we are far but we are worth it.

Fearless forecast: We will surpass Tokyo,...,"July 17, 2024","PHILIPPINE Olympic Committee president Abraham “Bambol” Tolentino was both fearless and realistic with his projection for the coming Paris Olympics.,“Definitely, we will deliver. Definitely, we will surpass Tokyo (Olympics),” Tolentino stressed in yesterday’s Philippine Sportswriters Association Forum at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.,Team Philippines reached its highest point in the Olympics three years ago in Tokyo when it won its first gold courtesy of weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz on top of two silvers and a bronze delivered by boxers Nesthy Petecio, Carlo Paalam and Eumir Marcial, respectively.,Tolentino said everything points to a similar or better medal haul in Paris where 22 Filipino athletes led by world No. 2 pole vaulter EJ Obiena and world champion gymnast Carlos Yulo and the five-strong boxing team will shoot for fame, fortune and glory along with other athletes in track and field, gymnastics, weightlifting, swimming, rowing, golf and fencing.,He said Filipino athletes are no longer lacking in support, training and motivation unlike during the years when the country couldn’t win any medal — or any color — in the Olympics.,Members of Team Philippines have spent the past couple of weeks in Metz, France, 90 minutes by train to Paris, and 30 minutes by land to Germany and Belgium, for the last phase of their training and acclimatization.,“With this template, with this preparation, we will deliver,” Tolentino said during the public sports program backed by San Miguel Corporation, Philippine Sports Commission, Philippine Olympic Committee, Smart/PLDT, Milo, and ArenaPlus, the leading sports entertainment in the Philippines.,The Paris Olympics will be held on July 26 to Aug. 11, and based on schedule, Yulo will get the chance to deliver the first medal for the country.,“One week na lang. Excited na lahat. May mga hindi na makatulog,” said Tolentino.,The POC chief, who was in charge when the country won four medals in Tokyo, said: “Pinaka-magandang conservative (forecast) is that we will surpass the Tokyo (haul). Actually, we surpassed the number of athletes from 19 to 22. My target was 25 if cycling and skateboarding (made it). Kung pumasok ang basketball, ibang usapan.,“But definitely we will surpass Tokyo. Bahala na kayo kung one gold, two golds or three golds basta ma-surpass natin ‘yung Tokyo. We’re all excited. Iba na ‘yung mood ng athletes, level up na lahat.

Life is a spiral: Mahintana,Neny Regino,"July 17, 2024","LAST month, I had the opportunity to join my office team that flew to South Cotabato to inaugurate and turn over two renovated and refurbished rural health units: the Baluan Rural Health Unit and the Polomolok East Community Clinic (PECC) which included a Polomolok Felicidad T. Sy Center Animal Bite Clinic.,It was also an opportunity for me to meet with the people behind the Mahintana Foundation, Inc. Mahintana, meaning “sea and land,” is so named to honor the first indigenous settlers of South Cotabato, the B’laans. The B’laans live around Lake Sebu and other municipalities of the province. The B’laan is one of the major indigenous, non-Islamic tribal groups in the country.,I was introduced to Lisa Duropan-Hora, the very dynamic executive director of the foundation, and for three days I bonded with her and got an intensive insight into the Mahintana Foundation. It turns out that she and our own Connie Angeles have been working together on projects like the HealthPlus Project in Lagao.,I was in awe of her bamboo handicraft project (basic production of bamboo handicrafts to maximize the use of the material which in turn has given birth to the extensive planting of bamboo). I was shown utensils made of bamboo which were on display at an event LawiL Di Afus.,Her Nutripan bread project, launched in partnership with Dole Philippines, seeks to improve children’s diets to reduce malnutrition by developing healthy and nutritious food. I was told by one resident that nutripan has variants like squash, carrots and sweet potatoes and because these sell out every day, plans are afoot  to increase production thus giving employment opportunities to women. These projects have had a domino effect on the livelihood of women in the community.,Because Polomolok is the site of a 22,000 plus-hectare pineapple plantation, livelihood support is given to farmers and their families for the processing of pineapple leaves from which is extracted the material that is the base of piñatex or pineapple fiber.,Coffee which thrives in Sultan Kudarat is one of the main and high revenue-generating industries that is being supported. Various training programs are conducted to improve the coffee industry.,Lisa has more projects like the Project Safe (support & sustain learning opportunities for children), ProPeace (projects for the improvement of security, tolerance & respect for the diversity of Tri-People); Adopt-a-School Program; SEED Farm Program (agriculture-based technologies & innovation; Ridge-to-Reef Program (consolidate development projects from the headwaters of Kilman & Siliway rivers); Gully Tree Planting and many more which if enumerated would take the whole page of this column.,The Mahintana Foundation was founded on Aug. 12, 1977. Mahintana then was under the direct supervision of Dole Philippines, Inc. until 1993 when it was spun off from Dole’s supervision. Today, Mahintana is governed by a board of trustees whose members come from corporate, business and social development institutions. Its programs and operations have beneficiaries in communities not only in South Cotabato but in other Mindanao provinces as well.,Its primary mission is to improve the target communities’ quality of life and make an impact on the development of their resiliency and sustainable development.,Over the years, Mahintana has established networks and linkages with many local and international organizations; partnering with local government units, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, the academe and other stakeholders.,The PECC and the Polomolok Clinic are joint initiatives with SM, particularly the Felicidad Sy Foundation to benefit GIDAs (geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas). The center is expected to be able to dispense medical and health services to 50,000 beneficiaries, mostly B’laan in Maligo, Landan, Kinilis, Silway 7, Upper Klinan, Klinan 6, Cannery 1, Cannery 2, Lamcaliaf and Palkan.,Geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs) refer to areas or communities with marginalized populations that are physically and socio-economically hard to reach or are separated from the mainstream society and characterized by the absence or limited access to roads, and thus have less or no opportunities at all for development, social services and food security. The health situation in GIDAs is generally characterized by high morbidity and mortality, resulting from poor access to quality health services, lack of health facilities and inadequate logistical support.,Other GIDA areas are located in Aeta-populated areas and T’boli areas.,For Mahintana Foundation president Martiniano Magdolot, the sustained collaboration with partners and supporters enabled it to innovate and strengthen programs, services and advocacies. “We are proud of our partnerships with our longtime partners and supporters who untiringly support the programs and advocacies of Mahintana.”,For indeed, life is a spiral, we reach out to those at the bottom of the spiral and help them climb up., ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_living/life-is-a-spiral-mahintana/

Edgar Mortiz returns  with the classics,...,"July 17, 2024","Today’s generation is perhaps not aware that long before Edgar “Bobot” Mortiz became a TV director for “Goin’ Bulilit” on ABS-CBN, he joined “Tawag ng Tanghalan” at age 13 in 1967 and became consecutive champions for years.,Nora Aunor came ahead of him and they were first paired onstage as singers before the Vilma Santos-Edgar Mortiz tandem became known.,“’Yung mga hindi nakakakilala sa akin sa simula, ako ang nakauna kay Nora Aunor,” Edgar smilingly shared. “Mali yata ang sabi ko. Ang ibig kong sabihin, ako ang naging unang kapareha ni Nora Aunor sa ‘Tawag ng Tanghalan.’,“Then, nagkaroon kami ng love triangle with Tirso (Cruz III), so nawala ako. Balik ulit ako sa pagkanta. Then nung nasa ABS-CBN ako at may show kami doon na ‘Operetang Putol-putol,’ doon ko nakita si Vilma Santos. Kaya ako din ang naging unang partner ni Vilma.”,Two years ago, before Edgar turned 68, he thought of recording an all-standards album and release it on vinyl before he turns 70. The man has been away from the limelight and detached from singing for decades.,“I started singing standards ever since,” Edgar disclosed. “Wherever I was then, I always did standards. After a while, when the eighties came, the likes of Madonna came into the music scene. They asked me to change my genre.,“The public had different music tastes at that time. They became more mature. So, I thought, why will I still sing if that’s not what I like? So I stopped singing when the eighties came. I no longer performed solo onstage. I sang mostly with groups.”,Eventually, Edgar had forgotten about singing. Through the years, he became a TV director, producer and still part-time actor.,“I would just sing at home,” he shared. “Up to this day, I still have my sound system and vinyl collection at home. My grandchildren would see my records and they would ask me to play them. I refused.”,His vinyls are all in good condition and still working. “I have a lot of vinyl records at home, mostly standards,” Edgar said. “Some were even from the sixties. Vinyl is coming back. There are sales of vinyls everywhere.,“Vinyls last a long time. They don’t get worn out. You need low maintenance to take care of the records.”,Thanks to Curve Entertainment recording executive Narciso Chan, who gave his nod to release Edgar’s all-standards album.,“I asked for Ciso’s help,” Edgar recalled. “I told him, kumanta ako sa Ipad and made him listen to the tracks. I asked Ciso, ‘Boss, pwede pa ba ko? I want to release an all-standards album.’ So we produced it.”,Edgar added, “That was what I wanted. ’Yun ang trip ko noon. The album had always been a passion project that has been brewing through my heart and mind. Those are songs which became part of my life then. Like when I became broken hearted, I had a song for that.”,His voice glides through all the standard tracks in the album. “You And Me (We Wanted It All),” “All My Tomorrows” – “I met my wife (Millet Santos-Mortiz) and I had no work at that time” – He also sang the ballad in the wedding of Al Tantay.,Edgar included “Somewhere in Your Heart” for his Ninong Ron (Fernando Poe, Jr.), “How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,” “You Will Be My Music,” “What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,” “You Turned My World Around” and “That’s Life.”,“All the songs have meaning in my life,” Edgar pointed out. “I chose all the songs which are my favorites from the time I was a teenager. Bata pa ako kinakanta ko na ‘yung mga standard songs.”,The album was finished last February so Edgar comes full circle now that “Goin’ Standard” is released. “I am turning 70 this August 30,” said Edgar. “Umabot naman ang album.,“The tracks are not perfect, but I told Ciso, ituloy natin ‘yan. If we want to make the songs perfect, I think kaya naman with today’s technology. How I really felt at the time I was recording, that was what’s important to me.”,At the recent album listening party of the eight-track “Goin’ Standard,” recorded by Pro-Ject Audio System, Edgar’s family and friends in and out of the entertainment industry arrived in droves and supported him. The event was held at The Gallery Bar of Crowne Plaza Hotel.,“Goin’ Standard” is now available in all digital streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Deezer, Amazon Music, YouTube Music and more. The vinyl can be ordered at Backspacer Records. 2F D’Ace Plaza, United St. corner Brixton St., Kapitolyo, Pasig City.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_entertainment/edgar-mortiz-returns-with-the-classics/
A teacher’s pride and joy,Gay Ace Domingo,"July 17, 2024","We have been teaching “Writing for Film” at the Ateneo de Manila University (our college alma mater) AB Communication Department since 2016. The course is an elective that is offered one semester every school year. It delves into the basics of writing narrative features for the big screen – from concept to the actual screenplay.,Every year, we are still surprised by number of students who enroll. Most of the time, the class size reaches around 20 students, even when the schedule is inconvenient, like in the evening or on a Saturday morning.,And we don’t think the reason is because of the teacher.,When we ask students at the start of the semester why they signed up, they simply say that they like watching films, or that they want to learn a new skill. Only a handful declare that they are aiming for a career in the Philippine entertainment industry.,So last week, on two occasions – at the media launch of the 20th Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival and at the reunion of Ateneo de Manila AB Communication majors – we bumped into former students who are pursuing careers in film. In spite of graduating recently, we believe they’re making a mark, ticking off items on their bucket list of dreams and doing something special. We’d like to write about them because they make us proud to be their teacher.,JP, as we fondly call him, is someone we see at film-related events like Ricky Lee’s birthday, the tribute for archivist Teddy Co, and Globe’s 2022 GOWatch Film Lab competition (of which he was one of the finalists).,Studious, dedicated, creative, the Cum Laude graduate and program awardee plunged into Ricky Lee’s scriptwriting workshop where he further developed his storytelling skills.,What we are most impressed with JP is his tireless pursuit to share meaningful stories, whether in film, print, or through live discussions. He’s become a voice of today’s young Chinese Filipinos.,Recently, JP received a grant from international NGO New Naratif to translate his grandparents’ writings into English, and give his reflection on these manuscripts. The result is a very unique publication called “Tracing My Grandparents’ Pen.”,There’s more to the Chinese Filipino experience than what mainstream media depicts. For this reason, JP’s perspective is much needed. He’s found his niche, and the world awaits the works of this dynamic writer-director.,Jake was part of one of two “pandemic” batches, whom, unfortunately we didn’t get to know well because all our sessions were done online.,But Jake, we remember because he was one of the passionate ones who submitted requirements ahead of time and even requested consultation sessions. He struck us as serious and a real go-getter. Not surprisingly, he graduated in 2022 with Summa Cum Laude honors.,He wrote, directed and produced a couple of short films in recent years. One of the most notable of which is “Write Here,” a queer drama about a lonely gay man stricken with Alzheimer’s disease.,“Write Here” has gone to several film festivals in the US and Europe, and received a FAMAS Best Short Film nomination. US-based film critic Jojo Devera called Jake’s film “a rare… cinematic drama executed with such consistent care.”,Jake has established his own outfit called Seiga Productions whose latest project is the Cinemalaya 2024 finalist “Kantil,” of writer-director Joshua Cesar-Medroso. Jake is the producer, along with renowned Mindanaoan filmmaker Teng Mangnansakan.,Jake is now working on his own full-length feature, “The Blind Man at the End of the World” – the screenplay he wrote for our class. Acclaimed indie producer Alemberg Ang is helping Jake bring this dream project to life.,With the secure way he moved about at the Cinemalaya launch – he even pitched to me to interview the director of “Kantil” – we’d say the young Jake feels right at home in the filmmaking community.,As a student, Ryan had a unique vibe about him. We won’t forget that he brought “baon” (like sandwiches) to class and ate his food during breaks in the three-hour session. Also, he always approached us after class to ask questions or to give an opinion.,We were by thrilled to hear his voice on the radio when he became a DJ of Magic 89.9. And, more thrilled to follow his journey  as an event host, film reviewer, performer, musician and content creator on social media.,A son of basketball coach Olsen Racela and actress/ marketing professional Melissa Puey, Ryan has certainly inherited his parents’ passion for sports and the arts. Although he didn’t become a basketball player, he can still make an awesome three-point shot … backwards!,Ryan’s gifts are his versatility and honesty. Please do check out the music video of his song “Young DZMA” for its nakaka-LSS melody, funny lyrics and wacky scenes.,He turned 27 recently. At the AB Comm reunion, Ryan told us something like feeling anxious about getting older and still not being able to accomplish what he wants to do. We found that surprising since, for us, he’s achieved a lot in a few years, while staying true to himself, promoting the things he believes in, and having a lot of fun in the process.,To young dreamers trying to find their place, unsure if they’ll ever get there or frustrated even by challenges… know that the world is still at your feet. We old dreamers haven’t lost hope. You shouldn’t lose faith, too.",https://malaya.com.ph/news_entertainment/a-teachers-pride-and-joy/

NMIXX teases new music,...,"July 17, 2024","LONDON – Performing with a live band gave South Korean girl group NMIXX new means to connect with audiences as they brought their “mix pop” sound to the British Summer Time (BST) Hyde Park Festival in London on Sunday.,The main stage performance marked a first for the six-piece, which is made up of members Haewon, Lily, Sullyoon, BAE, Jiwoo and Kyujin.,“When I heard that we were performing in this historical park, like, even just visiting here would have been fun but performing here is so crazy,” Australia-born vocalist Lily said in a post-show backstage interview.,“We honestly don’t have a lot of experience with festivals but this time we were lucky enough to perform with a band,” the 21-year-old singer, said.,“When you’re doing it with a backtrack, you can’t manipulate it as you go. But with a band you can work together and have good synergy and you can kind of slow it down if you want to or make it faster. I think that was an interesting thing that we were kind of all getting used to while preparing for the festival.”,NMIXX made their debut in early 2022 and have since released two extended play records, three single albums and toured across Asia and the United States.,The group’s track “Love Me Like This” recently surpassed 100 million streams on Spotify, with songs “O.O” and “DASH” closing in on 200 million streams on the digital music service.,The members have also attended European catwalk shows for a Spanish luxury brand, as an increasing number of fashion houses hire Asian stars for their highest-profile global promotional gigs.,Fans will not have to wait long for new music, said the group, who gave audiences at BST a taster of their as-yet-unreleased song “Moving On”.,“We’re working hard to bring out music that’s new and different,” Kyujin said.,“I think you’re going to get a hip mix that we haven’t shown you yet. It’s a little bit more free,” added Sullyoon. ",https://malaya.com.ph/news_entertainment/nmixx-teases-new-music/
