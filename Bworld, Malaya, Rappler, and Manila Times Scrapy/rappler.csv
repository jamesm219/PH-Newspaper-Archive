Track troubles: Why 11 Palaro athletics records got nullified,Christa Escudero,"Jul 17, 2024 9:48 AM PHT","CEBU CITY, Philippines – The controversial track oval at the Cebu City Sports Center (CCSC), which was used for the athletics events during the ,Palarong Pambansa 2024,, fell short of the 400-meter World Athletics standard distance.,Unfortunately, it’s the standout student-athletes who got hit hard by the negligence, resulting in the nullification of all records set in track events at 200 meters and farther.,“There are eight lanes and the average discrepancy is 0.88 meters,” Cebu City Sports Commissioner John Pages said during a press conference on Tuesday, July 16, following an investigation of the renovated track oval. ,“This is not a result of the oval not being standard. This is a direct result of the mistake in the lining.”,Lane 1 turned out to be the shortest at 1.5 meters off the standard 400m distance.,Athletics action already started when the discrepancy got discovered, which eventually saw a whopping 11 records getting nullified in four events – the 3000m steeplechase, 2000m walk, 400m hurdles, and 4x400m relay, all involving 19 athletes from five regions. ,But Pages said records set in the sub-200-meter events, including the record set by ,Western Visayas’ Mico Villaran, in the 110m hurdles, will be recognized by the Palarong Pambansa, but not by any other athletics body like the Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association (PATAFA), said Palarong Pambansa secretary general Francis Cesar Bringas.,Field events like javelin throw, long jump, discus throw, and shot put were unaffected.,Official scoresheets in the Palaro 2024 website showed a total of 13 records were broken in the track events, with only two – records set in the 110m and 100m hurdles – recognized by the tournament.  ,Let’s go back to February 2023, when Cebu City announced its bid to host the Palaro in 2024. ,“The year 1994 was a significant year for Cebu sports. It was the year when the Cebu City Sports Center was completed and when we last hosted the Palaro,” Pages told ,SunStar Cebu,.,“Thirty years later, we hope to bring it back to Cebu with the newly refurbished CCSC.”,The following May, the city government closed the CCSC to make way for renovations ahead of the Palaro and the preceding Central Visayas Regional Athletic Association (CVIRAA) meet. It had set aside a budget of P65 million and contracted SBD Builders to renovate the facility.,In August 2023, Cebu City’s bid proved to be successful as previous Palarong Pambansa host Marikina City passed the torch to the Queen City of the South. ,In November 2023, ,Cebu Daily News, reported that the renovation’s progress was still at 30 percent. CCSC executive director Jovito Taborada told the news outlet that the center is targeting to finish renovations by February 2024 and would request SBD Builders to fast-track operations.,February passed and May arrived, when a ,Philippine News Agency, report showed the rubberization of the track had yet to commence. Cebu City had to resort to using the track oval of the Sacred Heart School-Ateneo de Cebu as a venue for the ,CVIRAA, athletics events the same month.,On June 25, the newly renovated CCSC was finally inaugurated – less than two weeks before Palaro opened.,What other government projects has SBD Builders undertaken?,The contractor recently clinched a solar power project valued at more than P2 million after approval of the Cebu City Council on Wednesday, July 10, according to ,SunStar Cebu,.,Cebu City Councilor Noel Wenceslao had flagged earlier in May the company’s unfinished bridge project in Barangay Pulangbato, Cebu City, priced at P24 million. It was expected to be completed by September 2023.,Before the Palaro opened on July 9, reports on social media captured the track oval showing uneven rubberized surfaces. Pages assured the safety of the athletes and said that these “minor” signs of damage would be fixed before the games.,Turns out the track oval had another serious concern.,Pages detailed the discrepancy in each lane of the track:,“If we [take the average], that’s 0.88 [meters],” said Pages.,“Unfortunately, the rule, as explained by ma’am Jeanette Obiena (Palaro’s technical consultant), even if you are one centimeter short, even if it’s 399.99, that is still short.” ,“The contractor…is going to be called, and it will have to explain, and from there [the city council] will take the necessary steps,” Pages said on Tuesday.,Acting Cebu City Mayor Raymond Alvin Garcia called out SBD Builders on Monday, July 15, saying that the contractor will not be paid until all track oval issues are resolved. Meanwhile, Acting Cebu City Vice Mayor Dondon Hontiveros on Tuesday said the Cebu City legal office may review contract specifications with the contractor.,Rappler has reached out to SBD Builders for its comment and will update this story once we receive it. ,The contractor earlier asserted its competence to ,Cebu Daily News, in a July 12 report.,“SBD Builders is about integrity and standing by our workmanship. We are here to support the city of Cebu with their dedication to having a successful Palarong Pambansa event in our city,” said managing officer Shaun Doherty.,Despite the nullification of 11 Palaro records, Pages and Bringas assured the players who broke them will still be awarded their gold, silver, or bronze medals.,Some local government units, aside from giving incentives to medalists, also give separate incentives to record breakers. Will the players with nullified records still get to receive the latter reward?,Bringas deferred the decision to the local government units of the players concerned. “It’s not within our right or power to stop them from giving that. But I would recommend that they still do that,” the Department of Education assistant secretary said.,Will the two records to be honored by Palaro officials be certified by the PATAFA, the country’s athletics body, as well? Bringas said they will stay as Palaro records and “not records of PATAFA nor records of any other athletic organizations” in the country or internationally. ,Bringas previously deferred the validity of the records to the PATAFA during a separate press conference on Saturday, July 13. But in the Tuesday press conference, the official clarified that the track and field authority “is not in any way engaged” in this year’s national meet.,“The Palarong Pambansa is governed by its own board, and the PATAFA has no engagement whatsoever in the Palarong Pambansa. It just so happened that we also have…technical officials in athletics who are also members of the PATAFA, including our tournament director,” Bringas explained.,“They are members of the PATAFA but they are engaged in the Palarong Pambansa as a private individual and as part of the Department of Education and not in any way representing PATAFA.” ",https://www.rappler.com/sports/palarong-pambansa/records-nullified-track-oval-controversy-2024/
"After Trump shooting, the presidential race will change dramatically. And possibly violently.",Reuters,"Jul 14, 2024 11:21 PM PHT","WASHINGTON, USA – In a country already on edge, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump has enraged his supporters, paused the Democratic campaign and raised fears of further political violence in the run-up to November’s election.,Trump’s Republican allies painted him as a hero on Saturday, July 13, seizing on the image of him with his ear bloodied and fist raised, appearing to mouth the words “Fight! Fight! Fight!”,Whereas ,Trump, has regularly used violent language with his followers, advisers and allies of the former president flipped the script on his Democratic opponent President Joe Biden, saying it was the demonization of the Republican presidential candidate that led to the assassination attempt.,“Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination,” US Senator JD Vance of Ohio, a top candidate to be Trump’s running mate, said on X.,Biden moved quickly to try to defuse the situation, denouncing the attack as unacceptable political violence and pulling election ads attacking Trump.,“There’s no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick,” Biden told reporters.,The motivation of the shooter is not yet known. The suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, was a registered Republican, according to state voter records. He previously made a $15 donation to a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians.,In the ,short term,, the attack will likely boost Trump’s appearances in Milwaukee this week at the Republican National Convention as he accepts his party’s presidential nomination, fortifying the sense of grievance and estrangement his supporters already feel toward the nation’s political class.,Within hours of the shooting, Trump’s campaign sent out a text asking voters to contribute to the campaign. “They’re not after me, they’re after you,” the message read.,Billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Ackman also swiftly endorsed Trump. “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk said on X, the social media site he owns.,Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump’s campaign, said on X that “for years and even today, leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even Joe Biden have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump … it’s high time they be held accountable for it … the best way is through the ballot box.”,LaCivita was apparently referring to recent remarks by Biden made in the context of asking his supporters to focus on beating Trump rather than his own performance. “So, we’re done talking about the debate, it’s time to put Trump in a bullseye,” said Biden, who has always condemned any political violence.,The US is grappling with the biggest and most sustained increase in political violence since the 1970s. Of 14 fatal political attacks since supporters of Trump stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in which the perpetrator or suspect had a clear partisan leaning, 13 were right-wing assailants. One was on the left.,Despite being a former president, Trump has campaigned as an outsider insurgent, complaining that he has long been targeted by the federal “deep state” and Biden’s administration to prevent him from reclaiming power.,He has typically employed violent, degrading and even apocalyptic rhetoric while doing so, warning of a “bloodbath” if he is not elected and saying immigrants in the United States illegally are “poisoning the blood of our country”.,Some Republicans were already agitated by his continued stoking of the fire.,“If the country wasn’t a powder keg before, it is now,” said Chip Felkel, a Republican operative in South Carolina who has opposed Trump.,Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, said the shooting could benefit Trump politically because it feeds into his campaign narrative that the country is off-track.,“The attempted assassination creates sympathy for Trump,” Bannon said. “It also confirms the idea to voters that something is fundamentally wrong in this nation, which is an idea that drives support for him.”,Trump in May was found guilty of engaging in a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star, a conviction that did little to alter the race and suggested supporters of both sides remain entrenched in their positions.,Biden has dealt with a debate within his own party over whether he should step down as the Democratic candidate because of concerns that he is no longer fit for the job. He says his doctors have told him he is in good shape. Trump has benefited in some polls from Biden’s disastrous debate performance last month, but others show the race to be even.,Many voters have already been alienated by both Biden and Trump. The chaos that surrounds the candidates may contribute to voters feeling that the nation’s problems are unfixable and the gulf between the parties cannot be bridged.,US Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot by a gunman in 2017, told Fox News that violent election rhetoric needed to stop.,“All it takes is one person who is just unhinged to hear that and go out and act on it and think that’s their signal to go take somebody out,” he said. – ",https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/analysis-trump-shooting-us-presidential-race-change-violence-july-2024/
[Rappler’s Best] America,Glenda M. Gloria,"Jul 15, 2024 6:58 PM PHT","Just when we thought the US presidential campaign had turned to its most ,bizarre path,, with reelectionist President Joe Biden mumbling and fumbling and ,causing nightmares, among Democrats, a ,20-year-old American, was shot dead after ,shooting former president Donald Trump, at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday evening, July 13 (US time). ,Trump survived, the assassination attempt, but the presidential race will change dramatically and maybe even violently, ,Reuters said in this piece,. Investors and analysts ,shared their views, on what could happen next. And the Biden campaign ,shifted gears,, calling for unity and taking down all ads attacking Trump. Walden Bello paints a ,grim scenario, but also an “opportunity for the rest.” ,The last elected US president to have been wounded in an assassination attempt was Ronald Reagan, in 1981. In the land of milk and honey, ,four presidents have been killed in its history,.,I must admit that assassinations have been on my mind the past weeks after watching the TV series ,, a historical thriller inspired by the chase for the killer of Abraham Lincoln, the first American president to be felled by a bullet in 1865. I was just telling friends that, in a strange way, the series helped me situate the combustive landscape leading to the November elections. But not even the most cynical journalist was prepared for the kind of violence that erupted over the weekend in Pennsylvania.,The world awaits with trepidation as a wounded America grapples with this turbulence and elects its next president in barely four months. It’s terrifying.,Meanwhile, in our region, the wounds of war continue to heal. It’s been a week since Manila and Tokyo ,signed a military pact, that, once ratified, would facilitate, among others, joint military exercises between the two once-warring countries – wiping away any remaining scars from the savage Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II. ,China’s saber-rattling in the seas and against Taiwan give Manila and Tokyo every reason to put up a united front against aggression. ,This cherry blossoms relationship would have been unthinkable just three decades ago. As a reporter with the Manila bureau of Japan’s , newspaper in the mid-1990s, I recall covering the hottest issue involving the two countries then: comfort women. Japan has apologized for the sexual abuse of women at the hands of Japanese soldiers during World War II, but the victims’ demand for reparation has yet to be heeded. The ,first Filipino comfort woman, to come out and recall her harrowing experience was Lola Rosa, whom I interviewed various times back then.,To many Filipinos, however, Japan is now the gentle giant that has atoned for its sins – a reliable friend, a ,peace advocate,, a model of discipline, a dazzling world of ,pop culture,, a ,tourism mecca,. The Philippines, in fact, has become ,Japan’s second biggest source, of visitors among ASEAN countries, according to the latest available data.,More importantly, both nations share a common dread, China, and a mutual friend, America. But with their friend now in a catastrophic meltdown, Marcos and Kishida cannot possibly even begin to fathom what the coming months will bring. ,There’s China’s omnipresence, after all – even in Japan, which has centuries of protectionist policies. In last week’s visit to Tokyo, I made sure to visit the Tsukiji fish market that was built in the pre-war period. The grilled unagi beckoned and gave joy to the palate. When I asked where it was fished, the seller was honest enough to admit: China. Aghast, I asked: Are you sure it did not come from the West Philippine Sea? He gave a bewildered smile.,Here’s to less tumultuous waters – and politics. ,rappler.com/profile",https://www.rappler.com/voices/newsletters/best-united-states-elections-joe-biden-donald-trump/
Trump forges ahead in White House bid after surviving shooting,Reuters,"Jul 15, 2024 9:31 PM PHT","MILWAUKEE, USA – Donald Trump cements his hold on his Republican Party at its 2024 convention this week, having survived an ,assassination attempt, and navigated numerous legal tangles on the road to the party’s presidential nomination.,During the four-day event beginning on Monday, July 15, the former president will announce his choice for a running mate, having cited as frontrunners Ohio US Senator JD Vance, Florida US Senator Marco Rubio, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, all of whom will speak at the gathering.,While the event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, will be a festive affair to formally nominate Trump, it occurs at a ,tense moment in US history, on the road to the ,November 5 election, rematch between President Joe Biden, 81, and Trump, 78.,Will party leaders try to cool tempers among Republicans? Or will they use the occasion to accuse Democrats of demonizing Trump as a threat to democracy and making him a target for political violence?,“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” Trump told the Washington Examiner.,Biden, too, in a ,televised address, from the White House on Sunday, said: “There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.”,He said: “The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down.”,Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance.,House Speaker Mike Johnson, the country’s highest-ranking elected Republican, told NBC’s , show on Sunday that all Americans needed to tone down their rhetoric. He accused Biden’s campaign of making hyperbolic attacks on Trump.,“Everyone needs to turn the rhetoric down,” he said.,Biden condemned the assassination attempt. He ordered an investigation into Saturday’s shooting at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in which Trump’s right ear was grazed by a bullet, one supporter was killed and two others were wounded before Secret Service agents shot dead the 20-year-old suspected gunman whose motive has yet to be clarified.,The Biden campaign declined to comment on allegations from some Republicans that his previous comments helped created the conditions for the shooting.,Trump has frequently turned to violent rhetoric in his campaign speeches, using the word “bloodbath,” labeling his perceived enemies as “vermin” and “fascists,” and accusing Biden without evidence of a conspiracy to overthrow the United States by encouraging illegal immigration.,For Trump, the convention represents a test.,Having consolidated party control, Trump could seize on the prime time opportunity to deliver a unifying message or paint a dark portrait of a nation under siege by a corrupt leftist elite, as he has done at times on the trail.,“Trump’s convention speech is going to be his introduction to the general public, to the people who aren’t following politics closely. I think he will have even more eyeballs on him [because of the assassination attempt],” said Nachama Soloveichik, a Republican strategist who worked on Nikki Haley’s unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign.,“I would say the message should be one of de-escalation and also reminding people that America is better than that.”,In an internal memo to campaign staff on Sunday, which was obtained by Reuters, co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said the campaign would adopt additional security measures in the wake of the assassination attempt. They also called on staff to refrain from using “dangerous rhetoric.”,“We condemn all forms of violence, and will not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media,” they wrote.,Trump began the year facing multiple legal worries, including four separate criminal prosecutions.,He was ,found guilty in late May of trying to cover up hush money payments, to a porn star. But the other three prosecutions – including two for his attempts to overturn his defeat – have been ground to a halt by various factors, including a Supreme Court decision that found him to be partly immune to prosecution.,Trump contends, without evidence, that all four prosecutions have been orchestrated by Biden to try to prevent him from returning to power.,As with previous conventions, a who’s who of prominent Republicans, including media personalities and members of Congress, are slotted to speak.,They range from relative moderates to apologists for the ,January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, by Trump supporters and hard-right firebrands who have expressed support for conspiracy theories and are divisive even within the party.,The first three days of the event are organized around broad themes, with Monday focused on economic issues, Tuesday focused on public safety and Wednesday focused on national security.,Republicans are expected to portray America as more prosperous, less crime-ridden and less vulnerable to threats abroad during Trump’s 2017-2021 term than it is under Biden, though the record is decidedly mixed and difficult to compare given that the coronavirus pandemic had an impact on both the Biden and Trump presidencies in different ways.,Milwaukee will play a key role in the November 5 election given that it is the biggest city in Wisconsin, one of the most politically competitive states in the country.,By Sunday afternoon, security barricades around Fiserv Forum, the basketball arena where the convention’s main activities will take place, had shut down much of the city’s downtown. Thousands of armed law enforcement agents roamed streets that were otherwise largely empty as delegates streamed in from around the country.

"Trump picks onetime critic J.D. Vance, now a fierce defender, as his running mate",Reuters,"Jul 16, 2024 8:04 AM PHT","MILWAUKEE, USA – Republican Donald Trump selected J.D. Vance, a US senator from Ohio and author of the bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” as his running mate on Monday, July 15, elevating a politician who once criticized the former president in acid terms but has since become one of his most stalwart defenders.,The news, the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, emerged at the start of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to nominate the party’s presidential ticket. Soon after, Vance appeared at the event to the applause of party delegates but did not give any remarks.,“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media website.,The selection of James David Vance could help boost turnout for Trump in the November 5 election, particularly in some of the “Rust Belt” states where the election will likely be decided. The Ohio native is deeply popular with the Republican candidate’s base, and his populist message is well-suited for states that have significant working-class white populations and have suffered from de-industrialization.,A staunch conservative, Vance is unlikely to bring many new voters into Trump’s corner, however, and may even alienate some moderates. Some of Trump’s supporters had pushed him to select a woman or person of color as his No. 2 to expand a coalition that skews toward white men.,Several advisers to Trump said the former president, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, had focused on choosing a running mate he trusted and got along with.,Among those who had privately advocated for Vance, according to several sources familiar with the matter, were Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.,Though several donors told Reuters they were disappointed by the pick, another donor, oil businessman Dan Eberhart, saw the choice as a sign of Trump’s confidence in his campaign against President Joe Biden. Polls show the men locked in a tight race nationally, but Trump has a measurable lead in most of the battleground states that will decide the election.,“It demonstrates that Trump doesn’t feel he needs his VP to deliver any specific demographic or state,” Eberhart said. “He’s confident that he has this race wrapped up.”,In selecting Vance, Trump passed over other contenders, including U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.,At 39, Vance represents a younger generation in an election that features Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, bringing a counterweight to the Democratic ticket that also includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59.,Vance’s rapid ascent has been unusual for American politics. After an impoverished childhood in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, won a scholarship to Yale Law School and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.,He rose to prominence after 2016 when he wrote “Hillbilly Elegy,” in which he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown.,The book criticized what Vance saw as a self-destructive culture in rural America and sought to explain Trump’s popularity among poor white Americans.,Vance himself was harshly critical of Trump before and after Trump’s 2016 election win against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, calling him an “idiot” and “America’s Hitler,” among other epithets.,But as Vance geared up to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 2022, he transformed into one of the former president’s most consistent defenders, supporting Trump even when some Senate colleagues declined to do so.,Vance has played down the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and he has echoed Trump’s criticisms of the way the US Justice Department has prosecuted January 6 rioters, accusing the department of disregarding due process protections.,While the Republican Party historically stood for free markets and embraced foreign intervention as an important national security tool, Trump’s 2016 election opened up significant rifts within the party. Vance has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a stance at odds with many Republican legislative leaders.,On the campaign trail, the former venture capitalist has also served as a bridge between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have opened their wallets to Trump this election.,Vance’s anti-corporate rhetoric and his opposition to Ukraine aid gave some donors pause, and four donors told Reuters in the moments after the selection that they felt let down. Many contributors to the campaign were hoping for a business-friendly nominee who would expand the electoral map.,“Of all the choices he had, I think he chose the worst one,” said donor and metals businessman Andy Sabin, who had been waiting for Trump’s pick for running mate to see whether he would donate to the campaign.,“Vance is going to hurt Trump more than help him,” Sabin said, citing Vance’s Ukraine stance. “Now I definitely won’t donate.”,At least some senior campaign advisers were partial to Rubio, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Rubio has significant political experience and might have helped boost the former president’s support among Latinos.,Trump’s vice presidential selection process was drawn out and calibrated for maximum suspense.,While the former president started with an informal long list of at least a dozen people, he had whittled down his options over the course of 2024, with Vance, Burgum and Rubio emerging as the most serious contenders. Mike Pence, who twice served as Trump’s running mate, declined to endorse his former boss in this year’s election.,Many of Trump’s closest advisers did not know until Monday who the former president would pick.,Biden told reporters on Monday that Vance was a “clone” of Trump when it comes to policy issues. The Democratic president’s campaign, in a separate call with reporters, criticized Vance for his record advocating against abortion rights.,While Vance recently said he opposed federal restrictions on the use of abortion pills, a position Trump shares, he has frequently expressed support for abortion restrictions in the past. In a 2021 interview, for instance, he implied that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term. – ",https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/donald-trump-picks-jd-vance-running-mate/

We are not racist,” Villegas said in his homily, speaking in a mix of English and Filipino. “We are one in brotherhood and sisterhood in the Philippines, but we also know the sufferings of our brothers and sisters in mainland China – oppression, truth manipulation, human rights abuses.”,“The war of ideologies and the battle of politics can be won by the brotherhood of peoples. Before there was government, there were only loving, patriotic citizens. We are the peace that we dream for the world,” he continued.,“The peace of the Philippines will not come from the hands of superpowers, but from the heart of God and the hand of the Immaculate Mother,” Villegas said.",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/video-archbishop-socrates-villegas-sails-west-sea-pray-china/

Because on Saturday the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle, but an American lion got back up on his feet and he roared!”,Vance, 39, was a fierce Trump critic in 2016 but has since become one of the former president’s staunchest defenders, embracing his false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud.,Vance is deeply popular with Trump’s core supporters, but it remains to be seen whether he can broaden the ticket’s appeal. He shares Trump’s aggressive approach to politics, and his conservative statements on issues such as abortion could turn off moderate voters.,Soon after Trump’s afternoon announcement, Vance emerged on the convention floor with his wife Usha, shaking hands with and hugging delegates who swarmed the couple.

Kari Lake and Bernie Moreno, who are running in high-profile US Senate races in Arizona and Ohio, respectively, and US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas all called the flow of migrants an “invasion.”,Cruz delivered remarks suffused with Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, blaming Democrats for what he said was a wave of violent crimes committed by migrants.,While border crossings reached record highs during Biden’s tenure, arrests dropped sharply in June after the president implemented a broad asylum ban. Studies show immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born Americans.,Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and pledged to launch the largest deportation effort in US history, including the use of federal troops if necessary.,The divisive tone contradicted the message of national unity Trump had promised to deliver this week after the shooting.,Trump entered the arena around 8 p.m. local time (0100 GMT on Wednesday) to a raucous ovation, just as he did on Monday in his first public appearance since a gunman tried to assassinate him on Saturday at a Pennsylvania campaign rally. He was more ebullient than the night before, when he seemed emotional and more subdued than usual. A heavily bandaged ear served as a reminder of how narrowly he survived the attempt.,The shooting intensified fears among Americans about the deeply divided state of the nation ahead of the November 5 election.,A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that 80% of voters – including similar shares of Republicans and Democrats – agreed “the country is spiraling out of control” in the wake of the shooting.,Authorities were still trying to identify a motive for the shooting. The 20-year-old gunman was killed at the scene by the US Secret Service.,Vance, 39, the author of the bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” will deliver the headlining speech on Wednesday. His presence on the ticket is likely to energize core Republican voters, but it is less clear whether he can appeal to more moderate voters, including independents.,The Reuters/Ipsos poll found 29% of US voters, including 52% of Republicans, had a favorable opinion of Vance. By comparison, 42% of registered voters and 81% of Democrats had a favorable view of Biden’s running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris.,The survey of 992 registered voters, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, found Trump leading Biden by 43% to 41%, within the margin of error.,In his first campaign speech since the assassination attempt, Biden told Black voters in Las Vegas that he was “all in” for his reelection campaign, again dismissing calls from some Democrats to step aside.,The president said he was glad Trump had not been seriously injured but assailed his record in office. Biden has denounced the attack and called for less heated rhetoric.,The four-day convention will culminate with Trump’s prime-time address on Thursday, when he formally accepts the party’s nomination to face Biden in a rematch of their 2020 race.

NAIA employees to get 25% pay raise after privatization,Lance Spencer Yu,"Jul 17, 2024 10:25 AM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – Employees working at the ,Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), will soon receive a 25% pay bump once the group of San Miguel takes over operations in September.,No employee currently at NAIA is expected to lose their job right away either due to the privatization deal. All personnel involved in operations will be absorbed by the New NAIA Infrastructure Corporation – the company established by ,San Miguel’s consortium, that will run the airport. Anyone who isn’t absorbed by the group will remain with the Manila International Airport Authority as regulator.,“By September 13, San Miguel Group will be taking over. They have already made an offer to the employees,” Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said during a meeting of the Monday Circle Financial Forum.,“Their offer is that they will be given separation pay by the government. And then they will be given a signing bonus by San Miguel. They will be given a 25% increase in salaries,” Bautista said in a mix of English and Filipino.,The employees absorbed by San Miguel’s group will be hired under a probationary status, although they can be regularized if they prove themselves to the new private sector operator.,“, (San Miguel’s guarantee was if you pass their requirements), you will be regular employees,” Bautista said on July 8.,This could also be an opportunity for contractual employees – which make up about 50% of NAIA’s workforce – to get permanent positions, according to the transport secretary. ,However, the new operator still has the option to start shedding the employees that it inherited once the probationary period is up.,“, (That’s why I tell the employees at MIAA, if you want to stay with San Miguel, you have to perform well, which they really need to do),” he said.,Even while the bidding process was still ongoing, the transport secretary already gave assurances that there would be no immediate job losses, ,saying earlier, in January that “everyone will be given an offer.” San Miguel has made good on that promise, whether the pay bump is a way to buy peace or motivate its newly acquired employees. ,A capable workforce will be key to implementing the big plans that San Miguel tycoon Ramon Ang has for the airport. That includes pouring P122 billion to expand Terminals 1, 2, and 3, build new carparks, improve baggage handling systems and boarding bridges, among several other improvements.

[Pastilan] The Great Philippine Identity Sale,Herbie Gomez,"Jul 17, 2024 11:00 AM PHT","It started with about 200 fake birth certificates handed out to Chinese nationals in Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur. Now, it’s blown up to a whopping ,1,200 bogus birth certificates,. Isn’t bureaucracy grand?,That’s not just a statistical jump; it’s a neon sign flashing “regulatory chaos ahead,” and as if someone stumbled upon the bureaucratic Pandora’s box and decided to throw a fake identity fiesta.,A 21-year-old Chinese, Qui Halin, was recently arrested after the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) reported inconsistencies in his statements while he was applying for a passport. ,Based on the report, Qui couldn’t speak Bisaya or Tagalog. He’s a freshman at Ateneo de Davao University. That’s in Davao City, where his family runs a store in Chinatown, on Ramon Magsaysay Avenue. For his passport, he used the alias Hengson Jabilles Limonsero and flashed a Philippine birth certificate, PSA national ID, and a driver’s license.,The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) found Qui to have a Chinese passport and to be originally from Fujian, China, who moved to Davao City when he was 10. In 2013, he got his Philippine birth certificate in Santa Cruz. ,Note that the NBI investigation was an offshoot of the recent raids on ,Philippine offshore gaming operator, (POGO) hubs and the subsequent discovery of senators that ,Mayor Alice Guo, a.k.a. Gwaping of Bamban, Tarlac, used her late birth registration to claim Philippine citizenship and run for mayor in 2022.,The NBI’s discovery of the Santa Cruz birth certificate factory unleashed another verbal cyclone from the Senate against what’s really beginning to look like The Great Philippine Identity Sale.,This doesn’t look like just bureaucratic bumbling. The heart of the issue lies in local civil registrar offices resembling leaky boats in a stormy sea – prone to exploitation by those who’ve turned Filipino citizenship into the bureaucratic equivalent of a hot commodity on the black market.,We’re not just talking about a little clerical error or some bureaucratic hiccup. This is big. This is “fundamental questions of national security” big. This is “integrity of citizenship” big. You see, it digs deep into the soul of our system, revealing a nasty little underbelly in those local civil registry offices.,Let’s not kid ourselves – this isn’t a simple case of paperwork mix-up. It’s a full orchestra of systemic screw-ups, with loopholes in the spotlight and national security fumbling around backstage.,Apparently, we have well-oiled machines in our midst, exploiting these procedural loopholes for a tidy profit. It’s a racket. They’re not just filling out forms; they’re minting money by bending the rules. And what do we get? A compromised administrative process and a red carpet rolled out for all sorts of criminal shenanigans, all under the shiny banner of Philippine citizenship.,It looks like the gatekeepers are the ones leaving the door wide open and shouting, “Come on in, folks! Cheap citizenship for everyone, no questions asked!” It isn’t a glitch, it’s a full-blown system failure. And guess what? We’re the ones picking up the tab for this mess.,There’s a diplomatic subplot amid this bureaucratic mayhem. The involvement of people from China adds a spicy international twist, turning what initially looked like a run-of-the-mill paperwork problem into a potential diplomatic conundrum. It’s the kind that makes diplomats reach for the antacids.,The narrative arc here isn’t just about uncovering administrative shortcomings; it’s about fortifying the very foundation of national identity against predatory exploitation. It’s about ensuring that being Filipino isn’t a matter of paperwork but about shared values and responsibilities.,As legal actions heat up against individuals like Qui and the others implicated in these schemes, the spotlight shifts to our institutions. The NBI, the Bureau of Immigration (BI), and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) have been thrust into the limelight, tasked not just with resolving this crisis but with fortifying our defenses against future incursions into our national identity.,Senator Risa Hontiveros correctly pointed this out: Imagine someone using a fake identity to buy land or run for office. Next thing you know, your neighbor isn’t who you think he is – he’s just some dude who printed out a new identity like it’s a coupon for a free meal at Jollibee., read a statement from Hontiveros’ office. (Who are the people making this happen? Who are the accomplices or protectors? Is this only happening in Davao del Sur or all over the Philippines?),This should be seen as a wake-up call, a reminder that the sanctity of citizenship isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox but a cornerstone of national security. It demands not just legislative band-aids but a no-nonsense overhaul that plugs the gaps and fortifies the walls against future breaches.,While this developing saga of 1,200 fake birth certificates may read like a bureaucratic thriller, the real heroics lie in the realm of legislative reform and institutional resilience. ,Let’s hope that amid the drama and the diplomatic tightrope-walking, our lawmakers can rewrite this script into a tale where integrity triumphs, and Philippine citizenship shines brighter than any counterfeit paperwork ever could.,Filipino identity shouldn’t be something any Tom, Dick, and Harry can just pick up with groceries. It’s not like, “Hey, darling, grab some milk, a loaf of bread, and oh, throw in a Filipino identity while you’re at it!” No, no, no. Stop treating Filipino identity like it’s on sale at a flea market.,Lastly, always check your birth certificates. You never know who might be pretending to be you. , ",https://www.rappler.com/voices/thought-leaders/pastilan-fake-birth-certificates-great-philippine-identity-sale/

BIR: Online sellers on electronic marketplaces must now pay withholding tax,Lance Spencer Yu,"Jul 17, 2024 11:56 AM PHT","MANILA, Philippines – Online sellers or merchants on electronic marketplaces like Shopee and Lazada should now be paying more taxes that are to be withheld by these e-commerce sites, based on a Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) regulation that started July 15, Monday. , “Electronic Marketplace Operators will begin imposing withholding tax against their sellers/merchants starting July 15, 2024. We have already extended this by 90 days. No further extensions will be given,” BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui said in a press release on Tuesday, July 16.,He clarified that “withholding tax is not a new tax, it’s merely a system of taxation where taxes are collected at source, which will be credited against the total income tax liability of the sellers/merchants.” ,“The BIR aims to level the playing field between brick-and-mortar stores, which are regularly complying with their tax obligations, and online market places. Whether their business is operated online or through physical stores, sellers and merchants have to pay their taxes,” Lumagui added. ,Rappler’s tax columnist Mon Abrea said in an article last January that this is not a new tax. ,“This is not yet the digital tax. This withholding tax is in effect an advanced collection of the income tax due from the sellers/merchants…,” he said. You can learn more about this here: ,[Ask the Tax Whiz] Are online sellers/merchants required to pay taxes?,),In another piece ,Abrea wrote in February,, he said: “As clarified by [BIR] Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 8-2024, online sellers or merchants are required to register and pay their taxes. However, it is the e-marketplace operators and/or the digital financial service providers (DFSPs) which are required to withhold the 1% tax on gross remittances, and thereafter remit the same to the BIR.”,In late 2023, the BIR issued Revenue Regulation 16-2023, imposing a 1% creditable withholding tax on half of the gross remittances by e-marketplace operators, such as Shopee and Lazada, and digital financial service providers (DFSPs), such as GCash, to online merchants after their goods and services are sold through the platform. ,The BIR had previously extended the implementation “in recognition of the compliance needed with the relative policies or requirements of other government agencies and to give the affected parties an opportunity to adjust.” That extension has since passed, and the BIR confirmed that all electronic marketplace operators are now required to impose the withholding tax on sellers starting July 15.,Meanwhile, the BIR granted another 90-day allowance for DFSPs like GCash and Maya to “complete their respective system adjustments,” extending the prescribed transitory period until October 12, 2024.

Road workers discover cave likely untouched for millions of years in Cagayan de Oro,Herbie Gomez,"Jul 17, 2024 12:20 PM PHT","CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – Construction workers in a rural village in Cagayan de Oro accidentally discovered a cave, most likely untouched by human hands for millions of years until this week, revealing an astonishing underground world. ,The cave, described as a time capsule, contains stalactites and stalagmites that have been evolving for millions of years. With its formations still actively developing, the cave offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic processes of the planet, captivating the imaginations of locals and providing future opportunities for scientific study, research, and tourism.,“There’s water dripping, suggesting an ongoing formation. This excites us,” said Christine Camba, officer-in-charge of the protected areas division of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in Northern Mindanao.,The DENR has counted about a dozen caves in Cagayan de Oro, and the one in Dansolihon is not among them, according to Camba.,Workers stumbled upon the cave on Monday, July 15, while widening a section of road in one of the interior districts of Barangay Dansolihon, according to village chairman Jose Maria Juan Roa. The road is part of a network being developed by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to link the rural Cagayan de Oro village with Opol town in Misamis Oriental.,The road construction inadvertently expanded its entrance, making it accessible to humans for the first time.,“It appears to be a live cave,” Camba told Rappler, referring to initial photographs that rapidly circulated on social media.,Live caves, also referred to as active caves, reveal fascinating formations shaped by ongoing geological processes such as the growth of stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstones. These formations result from minerals deposited by water seeping through the cave’s surfaces.,At first glance, the Dansolihon cave embodies the essence of a live cave with its constant water flow and mineral deposition, setting it apart from dry or inactive caves where such processes have ceased long ago. ,Engineer Armen Cuenca, Cagayan de Oro’s environmental and natural resources chief, said the cave was known to a few villagers to exist “a long time ago” but remained unexplored and free from human activity for a still unknown number of millennia due to its very small opening.,“What is certain is that it has been there for millions of years. It’s alive,” Cuenca said.,A team from the city government and the DENR has been assembled and is set to inspect the cave on Wednesday, July 17.,Roa said he ordered the cave to be cordoned off, and declared it off-limits to the public to prevent potential damage from curious onlookers who quickly trooped in the area upon news of the discovery.,Camba said the cave remains uncharted territory, and both the DENR and local government have yet to assess and map it out to determine how best to manage it.,She cautioned that unauthorized exploration of the cave could lead to disaster.,“We have not conducted a full assessment. We are unaware of the potential hazards,” Camba said.,The local government said it would require strict adherence to national laws prohibiting cave entry.,According to the City Local Environment and Natural Resources Office (CLENRO), the Conservation and Protection of Wildlife Resources and their Habitats Act mandates the protection of caves as habitats for wildlife and ecosystems.,CLENRO also said the National Caves and Cave Resources Management and Protection Act designates caves as national treasures protected by law.,The law provides that cave locations should not be disclosed for one year following their discovery by the DENR and prevents their classification as tourist or study sites during this period. However, DENR, city government, and barangay officials confirmed that the cave was discovered in Dansolihon.,City hall also cautioned against extraction, possession, or sale of cave items, as well as engaging individuals to procure items from the newly discovered cave. It said such activities are considered offenses with corresponding penalties of imprisonment ranging from two to six years and fines from P20,000 to P500,000. – ",https://www.rappler.com/philippines/mindanao/workers-discover-cave-barangay-dansolihon-cagayan-de-oro-city/
"Another time’s the charm? Manila, Beijing OK presidential hotline on West Philippine Sea ",Bea Cupin,"Jul 17, 2024 12:30 PM PHT","The Philippines and China have expanded a previous maritime communication mechanism covering the West Philippine Sea, as tensions rise in waters that are within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) but that Beijing claims at its own. ,In a Wednesday, July 17 statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed that the two countries signed an “Arrangement on Improving Philippines-China Maritime Communication Mechanisms.” The existence of the deal was first reported by the ,. ,The agreement “provides several channels for communication” between the two countries on “maritime issues,” including: ,Hold on – another agreement? ,If you think that you’ve seen this film before, you’re right – you’ve definitely seen a version of it. ,Back in January 2023, during Marcos’ first (and only, thus far) state visit to Beijing, the two countries signed an ,agreement that established a communication mechanism, between the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). ,The new agreement, signed after Manila hosted a Bilateral Consultation Mechanism meeting on the South China Sea in early July 2024, now includes a hotline for representatives of Marcos and Xi. ,“The DFA is in discussions with the Chinese side on the guidelines that will govern the implementation of this Arrangement,” said DFA spokesperson Teresita Daza. ,Why a new agreement? Neither Daza nor the DFA gave an explicit explanation. ,But here’s what you should understand: first, it ,took a while for the first hotline to be set up, – because of delays on the Chinese side, Marcos himself told reporters back in May 2023. By then, a collision almost took place during a maritime patrol off the waters of Ayungin Shoal or Second Thomas Shoal. ,When it was up and running, the “hotline” turned out to be anything but hot – ,China did not pick up the phone, as the CCG used water cannons against the PCG in the West Philippine Sea back in August 2023, or would respond only hours later, after literal damage had already been done. ,In January 2024, following a BCM meeting hosted in Shanghai, the two countries agreed to “,improve,” the maritime hotline and agreed that it would include both the foreign ministries and coast guards of the two countries. ,Near collisions have become the least of the Philippines’ concerns in the West Philippine Sea. ,Aside from wielding water cannons with water pressures that could destroy the walls of wooden ships, the CCG has gone as far as towing, boarding, and destroying Philippine Navy dinghies during a ,resupply mission in June 2017,. The ,last BCM, took place in the shadow of that incident. ,China insists on its sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including in areas that are part of the Philippines’ EEZ. It’s led to tense, sometimes violent confrontations between maritime forces of the two countries in flashpoints like Ayungin Shoal or Scarborough Shoal. Filipino fishermen have also reported cases of harassment from the much larger vessels of the CCG or Chinese Maritime Militia. ,Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 arbitral ruling that deemed its sweeping claim over the South China Sea invalid. ,Would this maritime communication mechanism (president’s version) finally work? And would the two coast guards – one behind water cannons and “,piracy,” in the West Philippine Sea, and the other subject to danger because of the former’s actions – be able to iron out an agreement and make it work? ,Maybe third – or second – time’s the charm? It’s becoming harder to keep track. ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/inside-track/china-agree-presidential-level-hotline-west-philippine-sea/

Combining these factors leads to the average minimum wage worker earning around $58.91, or P3,448.21 a week.,The Philippines did not have the most average working hours, however. Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Qatar were noted to be the most overworked nations, with around 50 and 48 average work hours per week, respectively. ,These two countries, like other Gulf states, are popular host countries for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). According to Philippine Statistics Authority numbers as of 2022, the UAE was the second most popular destination, with over 260,000 OFWs, and Qatar had around 113,600.

"[Just Saying] SONA, Congress, accountability, and free speech",Mel Sta Maria,"Jul 17, 2024 9:00 AM PHT","The ,State of the Nation Address, is a constitutional directive. The President makes his report to the people. In that gathering done in the halls of the House of Representatives, we will see the presence of legislators and perhaps other public officials – who are, incidentally, commanded by the Constitution to live modest lives., It is a serious occasion to know if the President, through his speech, has done or omitted to do something for the nation, whether he is lying or telling the truth, has achievable plans or just mouthing empty platitudes, and is truly sensitive or not to the pulse of the nation.    ,In the SONA, we scrutinize the President’s performance. We do not celebrate him. The SONA is not his fiesta nor his yearly party with legislators, foreign dignitaries, and Supreme Court justices.,And so many wonder why ,P20 million, more or less, was reported as expenses for the event. And when it was revealed that it will include expenses for food, flowers, invitations, giveaways, rent for audio visual equipment, coordination of agencies, and others, they further wonder how it could reach that staggering amount.,Surely, invitations can just be given through e-mails, a lavish dinner skipped, decorative flowers dispensed with, giveaways not given, coordination among agencies undertaken by repeated memos through digital transmissions without incurring too must cost?,And seriously, are we also to understand that the House of Representatives, with its huge budget, has no audio-visual apparatus such that it must rent one? If true, that is sheer incompetence.,The insensitivity of this event is made more pronounced by reports that the Philippines has about 4.5 million homeless people with 250,000 of them children. The country has about ,2 million unemployed ,and, as of the end of February 2024, about P15.8 trillion in debt. Some of our soldiers and sailors have been risking their lives in asserting our sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea with meager resources compared to China’s.  ,More importantly, prices of important goods are rising. From the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data,,, for example, rose from P189.06 per kilo in May 2024 to P195.52 in June 2024. This may be insignificant to rich politicians but not to millions of our people.,Significantly, display of thoughtless extravagance amid a period “of acute public want” can be stopped by the courts (Article 25, Civil Code). Unfortunately, the case can only be initiated by a government or private charitable institution. Surely, the Philippine Charitable Sweepstakes Office will not do the filing. It will also be too much for a private charitable institution to further deplete its limited funds for such a case. The only thing remaining is a high sense of , on the part of government.,And then it was reported that House Secretary General Reginald Velasco said, , In short, no outfit manifesting protest will be allowed during the SONA.,That directive is unconstitutional. Non-violent protest is part of our democracy, doable anytime, anywhere and any place, provided it is peaceful. To wear a black arm band or outfit signifying protest is within the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech. It can be legitimately curtailed if there is a clear and present danger imperiling the government’s existence. Surely, that will not happen during the SONA. ,Remember: the people own the Batasan building, public money will be spent, and the event is vested with public interest. The prohibition exhibits ignorance of our fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution’s Bill of Rights.,Think of all the opposition legislators wearing a protest outfit peacefully waiting for the President’s speech, one can imagine the distasteful scene of the congressional sergeant-at-arms and his men – in full view of foreign diplomats, the Supreme Court justices and the televiewers – escorting all of them outside the Batasan building, leaving only the President’s allies giving intermittent applause and standing ovations. It might be, after all, President Marcos Jr. enjoying himself preaching to the choir.  ,It will be a revolting and shameful sight for an administration that preens itself of respecting diversity in our society.,A rule of decorum cannot defeat the exercise of constitutional rights. In law, any public officer or employee, or any private individual, who directly or indirectly, obstructs or, in any manner, impedes the freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for redress of grievance shall be liable for damages (Article 32, Civil Code). Presence of malice or bad faith is not necessary. (Lim vs. Ponce De Leon G.R.
