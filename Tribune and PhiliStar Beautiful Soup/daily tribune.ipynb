The phenomenon is so widespread that it has become a subject of sociological research in recent years.', 'While many studies focus on the characteristics of abusive bosses, few examine the reasons why workers put up with this damaging form of authority.', 'Researchers at Ohio State University and Providence College studied the psychological mechanisms at work when dealing with a problematic manager. To do this, they first surveyed 576 US workers from a variety of industries. They asked them three times over a six-week period about the abusive behaviors of their hierarchical superior and the latter’s effectiveness at work.', 'The researchers found that employees tend to minimize their manager’s abusive behavior when they consider their leader’s performance to be high. From their point of view, their superior’s excesses are the expression of a form of tough love, not maladaptive behavior.', 'On the other hand, workers are much more likely to identify their boss’s managerial excesses when they seem incompetent.', '“If employees see their boss as a successful leader, that seems to be incompatible with being abusive. So they label the abuse as something more positive, like tough love,” says study lead author Robert Lount, quoted in a news release.', 'But what accounts for these differing interpretations? Optimism, it seems.', 'Indeed, employees with a high regard for their abusive manager are convinced that kindness will eventually win out over ruthlessness. They believe they will eventually be rewarded for their efforts, for example, with a promotion.', '“These bosses may treat employees harshly, but presumably their intent is to help their followers realize their potential — that’s the tough love part. And if the leaders have high performance, that suggests they are successful at bringing out the skills of their followers,” says study coauthor Bennett Tepper.', 'Since the first part of their study was based on statements, the scientists decided to conduct a laboratory experiment to support their reasoning.', 'They recruited 168 undergraduate students, who were led to believe that they were going to work in teams under the supervision of an MBA student to solve a problem. While they were working, the volunteers received a message supposedly sent by their team leader.', 'The message was written in such a way as to be either non-abusive (“Try hard!”) or more aggressive (“Don’t waste my time coming up with stupid ideas! Do better than a typical undergrad and don’t embarrass us!”)', 'Each team had to present its ideas to the team leader before they were examined by an independent expert. The researchers would then let the participants know whether they had done better or worse than their competitors. Whatever the result, the students were then asked to rate their supervisor.', 'Unsurprisingly, the students were less affected by their team leader’s abusive behavior when the researchers told them they had performed well on the exercise. Conversely, those who had underperformed were more likely to say they had been the victims of abusive management.', '“We found that in a very short amount of time, you could quickly abate abusive labeling of a boss with high performance,” says Robert Lount.', 'The findings of this study show that employees can turn a blind eye to their superior’s toxic behavior if they think that the leader achieves high performance at work. This psychological phenomenon, which is in a sense similar to cognitive dissonance, could explain why toxic management is so insidious.', 'But it is no less harmful.', 'Employees who are exposed to it may experience symptoms similar to those associated with other forms of workplace harassment, such as sleep disorders, dark moods, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.'], 'link': 'https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1960759/why-some-workers-might-view-a-managers-toxic-behavior-as-tough-love'}\n",

The company’s efforts have not only increased awareness but have also created significant advocacy that has led to the industry’s success. According to WR Numero, a leading research firm in the Philippines, awareness of Angkas is notably high, with 48% of Filipinos recognizing the brand. Furthermore, the study reveals that 45% of Filipino participants now use habal-habal for transportation, with 14% reporting regular usage and 11% using it two to four times weekly.', 'A recently published study by WR Numero reveals that 58% of Filipinos “agree with or strongly support” the legitimization of habal-habal, an unregulated motorcycle transport service. Additionally, 78% of Filipinos consider having an advocate in Congress essential, underscoring the significance of MC Taxis in the lives of Filipino commuters. The WR Numero Philippine Public Opinion Monitor, a pioneering and innovative public opinion research initiative, surveyed individuals 18 years and older nationwide regarding habal-habal. These findings highlight Angkas’ instrumental role in bringing nationwide awareness and advocacy for the motorcycle taxi industry.', 'Since its inception in 2016, Angkas has tirelessly worked to dispel the belief that using motorcycles to ferry passengers is unsafe, proving that with proper training and education, motorcycle taxis can be a viable and safe alternative form of transportation. The company has set new standards in the industry, demonstrating its commitment to safety and reliability. By 2019, Angkas had established its safety credentials with a remarkable 99.997 percent safety record, as presented in multiple court and congressional hearings. This success led to the Department of Transportation (DOTr) forming a technical working group (DOTr-TWG) to pilot a feasibility study on MC Taxis, with Angkas and 2 other players participating.', 'Transitioning from the achievements of Angkas, George Royeca, co-founder and now CEO, has emerged as a leading transport advocate. For nearly a decade, Royeca has championed job opportunities for habal-habal riders and provided legitimate two-wheel transport options for commuters. His visionary leadership has been central to Angkas’ success and the elevation of the motorcycle taxi industry.', 'In its early days, Angkas faced multiple threats of termination due to regulatory challenges and skepticism about the safety of MC Taxis. Royeca addressed these concerns by implementing rigorous biker training and promoting excellent service delivery to ensure safety and viability. To date, over 50,000 motorcycle drivers have been lifted out of poverty through Angkas, thanks to Royeca’s biker welfare initiatives like reliable loan programs, benefits, and incentives that formalized the once-informal habal-habal sector.', 'Royeca’s dedication to the motorcycle taxi industry and his advocacy efforts have paved the way for significant developments. The strong support (58%) for legitimizing habal-habal riders underscores the success of Royeca and Angkas in advocating for the inclusion of the informal sector in the country’s labor force and in offering commuters a safe, quick, and comfortable transport experience. Currently, Congress is working on regulatory laws for MC Taxis, structured according to the TWG’s recommendations. Royeca and Angkas’ belief in habal-habal riders has paved the way for this historic development in the local transport industry.', 'Angkas’ success in reaching nationwide consciousness and creating awareness and advocacy has been pivotal in the motorcycle taxi industry’s growth. George Royeca’s leadership and relentless advocacy have made him a champion of the industry and the 18 million-strong motorcycle rider community. Together, Angkas and George Royeca continue to drive forward the industry, ensuring a brighter future for millions of motorcycle riders across the Philippines.'], 'link': 'https://globalnation.inquirer.net/242419/transforms-stigma-into-opportunity-as-filipinos-support-formalizing-habal-habal'}\n",

Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio and author of the bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” as his running mate on Monday, elevating a politician who once criticized the former president in acid terms but has since become one of his most stalwart defenders.', 'The news, the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, emerged at the start of the four-day Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to nominate the party’s presidential ticket. Soon after, Vance appeared at the event to the applause of party delegates but did not give any remarks.', '“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media website.', 'The selection of James David Vance could help boost turnout for Trump in the Nov. 5 election, particularly in some of the “Rust Belt” states where the election will likely be decided. The Ohio native is deeply popular with the Republican candidate’s base, and his populist message is well-suited for states that have significant working-class white populations and have suffered from de-industrialization.', 'A staunch conservative, Vance is unlikely to bring many new voters into Trump’s corner, however, and may even alienate some moderates. Some of Trump’s supporters had pushed him to select a woman or person of color as his No. 2 to expand a coalition that skews toward white men.', 'Several advisers to Trump said the former president, who survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania campaign rally on Saturday, had focused on choosing a running mate he trusted and got along with.', 'Among those who had privately advocated for Vance, according to several sources familiar with the matter, were Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.', 'Though several donors told Reuters they were disappointed by the pick, another donor, oil businessman Dan Eberhart, saw the choice as a sign of Trump’s confidence in his campaign against President Joe Biden. Polls show the men locked in a tight race nationally, but Trump has a measurable lead in most of the battleground states that will decide the election.', '“It demonstrates that Trump doesn’t feel he needs his VP to deliver any specific demographic or state,” Eberhart said. “He’s confident that he has this race wrapped up.”', 'In selecting Vance, Trump passed over other contenders, including U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Tim Scott and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.', 'At 39, Vance represents a younger generation in an election that features Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, bringing a counterweight to the Democratic ticket that also includes Vice President Kamala Harris, 59.', 'Vance’s rapid ascent has been unusual for American politics. After an impoverished childhood in southern Ohio, he served in the Marine Corps, won a scholarship to Yale Law School and later worked as a venture capitalist in San Francisco.', 'He rose to prominence after 2016 when he wrote “Hillbilly Elegy,” in which he explored the socioeconomic problems confronting his hometown.', 'The book criticized what Vance saw as a self-destructive culture in rural America and sought to explain Trump’s popularity among poor white Americans.', 'Vance himself was harshly critical of Trump before and after Trump’s 2016 election win against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, calling him an “idiot” and “America’s Hitler,” among other epithets.', 'But as Vance geared up to run for the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 2022, he transformed into one of the former president’s most consistent defenders, supporting Trump even when some Senate colleagues declined to do so.', 'Vance has played down the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and he has echoed Trump’s criticisms of the way the U.S. Justice Department has prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters, accusing the department of disregarding due process protections.', 'While the Republican Party historically stood for free markets and embraced foreign intervention as an important national security tool, Trump’s 2016 election opened up significant rifts within the party. Vance has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued aid to Ukraine in the Senate, a stance at odds with many Republican legislative leaders.', 'On the campaign trail, the former venture capitalist has also served as a bridge between Trump associates and wealthy Silicon Valley donors, many of whom have opened their wallets to Trump this election.', 'FRAUGHT SELECTION PROCESS', 'Vance’s anti-corporate rhetoric and his opposition to Ukraine aid gave some donors pause, and four donors told Reuters in the moments after the selection that they felt let down. Many contributors to the campaign were hoping for a business-friendly nominee who would expand the electoral map.', '“Of all the choices he had, I think he chose the worst one,” said donor and metals businessman Andy Sabin, who had been waiting for Trump’s pick for running mate to see whether he would donate to the campaign.', '“Vance is going to hurt Trump more than help him,” Sabin said, citing Vance’s Ukraine stance. “Now I definitely won’t donate.”', 'At least some senior campaign advisers were partial to Rubio, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Rubio has significant political experience and might have helped boost the former president’s support among Latinos.', 'Trump’s vice presidential selection process was drawn out and calibrated for maximum suspense.', 'While the former president started with an informal long list of at least a dozen people, he had whittled down his options over the course of 2024, with Vance, Burgum and Rubio emerging as the most serious contenders. Mike Pence, who twice served as Trump’s running mate, declined to endorse his former boss in this year’s election.', 'Many of Trump’s closest advisers did not know until Monday who the former president would pick.', 'Biden told reporters on Monday that Vance was a “clone” of Trump when it comes to policy issues. The Democratic president’s campaign, in a separate call with reporters, criticized Vance for his record advocating against abortion rights.', 'While Vance recently said he opposed federal restrictions on the use of abortion pills, a position Trump shares, he has frequently expressed support for abortion restrictions in the past. In a 2021 interview, for instance, he implied that victims of rape and incest should be required to carry pregnancies to term.\\xa0'], 'link': ['https://malaya.com.ph/news_news/trump-picks-onetime-critic-j-d-vance-now-a-fierce-defender-as-his-running-mate/']}\n",

Electronic waste (e-waste) has increasingly grown at an alarming rate reaching thrice the world’s population growth as of 2014, and presumably even higher with a decade gone by. E-waste refers to obsolete or discarded electronic devices containing toxic chemicals such as dioxins, lead, and mercury. These substances pose harmful effects to human health when improperly disposed of, especially for pregnant women and children. For over 12 years, The E-Waste Project (TEP) has been raising awareness for responsible e-waste management and disposal within the community through collection drives, webinars, and online campaigns. This project is an awareness program byUP Circuitdesigned to address the growing issue of e-waste in the country and educate people on how to tackle it. The initiative’s latest iteration in 2023 achieved its largest collection yet, amassing a total of 9,654 kilograms of electronic waste. With hopes of a greater reach in their advocacy, The E-Waste Project will conduct their series of events this July 2024. There will be twoTEP Talks, which are online webinars aimed at educating and motivating individuals to identify and address the issues associated with improper e-waste disposal. The first TEP Talk will be held onJuly 20with the topic “E-Waste and Health: Understanding the Risks.” On the other hand, the second webinar will take place onJuly 27, with the topic on “Reducing E-Waste: Tips for Minimizing Electronic Waste at Home.” Both TEP Talks will start at 2 p.m. via Zoom and will also be livestreamed on TEP’s Facebook Page. Interested attendees can join through the registration link posted on The E-Waste Project’s social media pages. A great addition to the TEP projects, calledTEP2F,was also introduced in June. Selected members of the team visited the PropertyCompany of Friends, Inc. in Mandaluyong and Tzu Chi Scholars Summer Camp in Sta. Mesa to talk about the environmental impact of e-waste and its practical disposal solutions. TEP will also be relaunching itsin-person collection drivefromJuly 21 to 27, 2024,at theEngineering Lawn, UP Diliman. Drop-off points are already available starting July 8 and will be open until the last day of the collection drive on July 27. The drop-off points are spread across the University of the Philippines-Diliman Campus and at the Buddhist Tzu Chi Campus in Sta. Mesa, Manila. The E-Waste Project advocates for innovation that serves as a tool that we can leverage to enhance sustainability and protection rather than be the cause of more environmental problems. In its 12thyear, the E-Waste Project continues to widen its reach through new events and greater influence with the help of all volunteers and participants. There is a responsibility that comes with today’s advancements and every sTEP taken towards addressing this current problem is progress to a better and greener future.Para sa bayan, para sa mundo.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/sparkup/2024/07/17/608618/every-step-counts-the-e-waste-projects-12th-year-in-environmental-service/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Visitor receipts rise by 33% in first half', 'author': ['Justine Irish D. Tabile'], 'date': 'July 12, 2024 | 12:31 am', 'article': ' VISITOR RECEIPTS rose by 33% in thefirst six months of 2024, while international arrivals hit 3.17 million as of July 10, the Department of Tourism (DoT) said on Thursday. In a statement, the DoT said tourism receipts from inbound visitors hit P282.17 billion in the January-to-June period, about 32.8% higher than P212.47 billion a year earlier. The country welcomed 3.17 million inbound tourists as of July 10. Majority or 92.6% were foreign tourists, while the rest were overseas Filipinos. The latest tally represents 41.2% of the department’s 7.7 million target for international visitor arrivals this year. “This rise from last year’s figures not only showcased the growing appeal of the Philippines as a premier travel destination but also underscored the tangible benefits that tourism brings to our economy and our people,” said Tourism Secretary Maria Esperanza Christina G. Frasco. South Korea remained the top source of foreign arrivals during the period, accounting for 26% or 824,798 of the total. Rounding up the top five sources of inbound tourists are the United States with 522,667 (16.5%), China with 199,939 (6.3%), Japan with 188,805 (6%) and Australia with 137,391 (4.3%). Other sources of tourists include Taiwan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Malaysia. Citing the 2024 Economic Impact Research of the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the DoT said 2024 is forecast to be a “record-breaking” year for the Philippines in terms of the tourism industry’s economic contribution, employment, and visitor spending. In its report, WTTC projected the travel and tourism sectors’ contribution to the national economy to reach P5.4 trillion this year. This will be a 25% increase from last year and will surpass the pre-pandemic level in 2019 by 7.1%, the DoT said. Philippine Statistics Authority data showed the tourism industry’s direct gross value added, which measures the value generated from various tourism-related activities, stood at P2.09 trillion in 2023, accounting for 8.6% of gross domestic product. Meanwhile, the WTTC pegged international and domestic visitor spending at P715.6 billion and P3.7 trillion, respectively, this year. This will exceed 2019 levels by 5.7% and 1.8%, respectively. In 2023, tourism-related spending by nonresidents was P697.46 billion, while domestic visitor spending was P2.67 trillion. “In the second half of the year, we anticipate these numbers to increase, not only the revenue generated but most importantly, the number of Filipinos employed in tourism-related industries,” Ms. Frasco said. At the MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) Con 2024 held at the SMX Convention Center in Clark, she said the tourism industry employed over 6.21 million Filipinos last year, representing a 6.4% growth from 2022. Citing WTTC, the DoT said the travel and tourism industry is projected to account for 9.5 million jobs, or 20% of the national workforce, this year. Meanwhile, Ms. Frasco said the development of the MICE sector is crucial to generating employment opportunities and livelihoods for Filipinos. “One of our strategic goals is to diversify our tourism portfolio by investing in high-value tourism products, services and experiences such as MICE and other special events in tourism,” she said. She said MICE tourism is a big opportunity because delegates spend an average of over $573 per day, about five times more than the average leisure tourist. “By positioning the Philippines as a premier MICE destination in Asia, we foster economic growth and provide invaluable opportunities for expansion,” she added. However, she said the country still faces challenges in positioning itself as a MICE powerhouse. “That is why we have worked in collaboration with our fellow government agencies in order to ensure that we improve accessibility and connectivity, as well as opportunities for our communities to benefit from our thriving tourism sector,” she said. —Justine Irish D.

      "{'title': 'You win some, you lose some in peso battle', 'author': ['Aaron Michael C. Sy, '], 'date': 'July 12, 2024 | 12:32 am', 'article': 'ByAaron Michael C. Sy,Reporter THE PHILIPPINE peso’s steady decline against the dollar — an almost two-year record low — is no longer a black-and-white case of exporters and other dollar earners winning and heavy corporate borrowers losing big time. The same can be said about the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) steady march toward monetary easing in the coming months for the first time since November 2020, which begs the question of who will win and who will lose once the rate cuts are finally delivered. Take the case of Mega Prime Foods, Inc., a leading brand of sardines and other canned fish products that is now forced to manage costs and investments more intensely because its packaging, raw materials, finished goods and other key capital expenditures are foreign currency denominated. “We are not hedged in our revenue and spending,” Chief Executive Officer Michelle Tiu Lim-Chan said in a Viber message. “On the other hand, it is better for our export business, but our primary source of revenue is the domestic market.” Tricia Anna Enriquez, a 25-year-old freelancer based in Manila, is earning P1,000 ($17) more weekly as the peso, which has lost more than P3 against the dollar this year, continues to dive in value. “The dollar is strong, so I earn a lot more now,” she toldBusinessWorld.“My usual P15,000-a-week income is now P16,000.” The peso closed at P58.305 per dollar on Thursday, strengthening by 1.5 centavos from its P58.32-a-dollar finish on Wednesday. This was the peso’s strongest finish in more than a month or since its P57.97 close on May 28. It has been trading at the P58-a-dollar level since May, a weakness that the Philippine central bank has attributed to safe-haven demand for the dollar amid geopolitical tensions and hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. John Paolo R. Rivera, president and chief economist at Oikonomia Advisory & Research, blames the Fed, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high amid stubborn inflation, for the dollar’s strength. “This benefits exporters and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and those earning foreign currency because their dollar earnings now have more value in pesos,” he said in a Viber message. The BSP’s signals of an early policy easing before the Fed has led to further peso depreciation, Leonardo A. Lanzona, an economics professor at the Ateneo de Manila University, said in an e-mail. “Indeed, the dollar value has strengthened, but the immediate effect of prospective lowered interest rates here even before the Fed reduces their rates seems to have created greater damage,” he said. The BSP would probably cut its policy rate after the US Federal Reserve, which had signaled it might start easing as late as December, Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto said earlier. Mr. Recto, who is a member of the BSP’s policy-making Monetary Board, expects as much as 150 basis points (bps) of cuts in the next two years. On the other hand, BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. has signaled a rate cut as early as August — potentially before a Fed easing. Total rate cuts this year could go as high as 50 bps, he said. The Monetary Board has kept its benchmark rate steady at a 17-year high of 6.5% since October 2023 after 450 bps in rate increases to tame prices. Jonathan L. Ravelas, senior adviser at Reyes Tacandong & Co., said the growing sea tensions between the Philippines and China are adding to the peso jitters. Local importers are clearly disadvantaged by the weaker peso because their purchases are mostly dollar-denominated, while exporters benefit because their products are now worth more, he pointed out. DOUBLE-EDGED SWORDWhile this is true, the benefits are far from equal among exporters. “Exporters that generate more local value-added are expected to reap larger benefits,” Trade Undersecretary Jose Edgardo G. Sunico said in a Viber message. These include resource-based and service exporters such as companies in the information technology, business process management and tourism sectors, he added. “The impact of a weaker Philippine peso on exports varies across sectors,” Mr. Sunico said. Exports should benefit as Philippine goods and services become more price competitive, but those that rely heavily on imported raw materials and inputs would benefit less, he added. “The business outlook will be impacted by these market dynamics, with exporters remaining optimistic about growth, while import-reliant industries are more cautious of the economic challenges posed by a weaker peso,” Mr. Sunico said. While importers are probably hurt by the depreciating peso, they are far from helpless, Sergio Ortiz-Luis, Jr., president of the Philippine Exporters Confederation, Inc., said by telephone. Filipino importers particularly in the agriculture sector are now trying to use local raw material substitutes to ease the blow from the strong dollar, he said. “So their consumable goods will have fewer import [components],” he said in mixed English and Filipino. The peso’s persistent weakness can also be a double-edged sword for Filipino families that rely on a relative who works overseas. A strong dollar means more value in remittances sent by OFWs, Ellene A. Sana, executive director of the Center for Migrant Advocacy, said by telephone. But they could likewise end up sending less dollars given the higher peso value of these remittances, Mr. Ravelas said. Cash remittances from OFWs rose by 3.1% year on year to $2.562 billion in April — the fastest since December but the lowest in 11 months, according to BSP data. Month on month, remittances fell by 6.4%. The peso depreciated by P1.52 against the dollar that month. OFW families like most Filipinos obviously have to contend with rising prices including food. “Inflation is rising faster compared with the peso’s weakening, so the effect on OFWs could still be negative,” Ms. Sana said. “If you’re sending the same amount of dollars, the worth in peso could be higher but it will afford less goods,” she said. Despite remittance optimism due to the dollar’s strength, OFWs are still wary about sticky inflation, Ms. Sana said. Inflation eased to 3.7% in June from 3.9% in May, still within the BSP’s 2-4% annual target. It averaged 3.5% in the first half. “You have to connect it to the end user of the money. Your end user, who is in the Philippines, is finding inflation problematic,” Ms. Sana said. Mr. Lanzona said local companies are more exposed to the weak peso. “This group has been among the most active spenders and borrowers of dollar-linked instruments over the past decade, either by choice due to lower cost or by necessity given the [limited] size of domestic funding sources,” he said. While companies in other Southeast Asian countries are standing up to the dollar, local companies big and small face difficulties in expanding production or exports and are failing to take advantage of the depreciation, he added. The peso would likely continue its free fall in the coming months due to inflation and slowing demand for domestic funds, which could force the BSP to intervene in the currency market, the economist said. It could also keep rates high, which could slow economic growth targeted at 6-7% this year, he pointed out. The Philippine economy grew by 5.7% in the first quarter, slower than expected. Mr. Ravelas expects a persistently weak peso until the Fed finally begins its easing cycle. The peso would probably end the year at P58 as it gets boosted by remittances during the Christmas holiday — still weaker than the P55 to P56 levels reached at the start of the year.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/12/607647/you-win-some-you-lose-some-in-peso-battle/'}\n",

', 'Jocson, '], 'date': 'July 12, 2024 | 12:33 am', 'article': 'ByLuisa Maria Jacinta C.Jocson,Reporter THE PHILIPPINE banking industry’s total assets jumped by an annual 12.4% as of end-May, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data showed. Banks’ combined assets increased to P25.62 trillion from P22.79 trillion a year ago, according to preliminary data. Month on month, total assets inched up by 0.5% from P25.48 trillion as of end-April. Banks’ assets are mainly supported by deposits, loans, and investments. These include cash and due from banks as well as interbank loans receivable (IBL) and reverse repurchase (RRP), net of allowances for credit losses. The banking sector’s total loan portfolio inclusive of IBL and RRP climbed by 10.4% to P13.42 trillion as of end-May from P12.16 trillion in the previous year. Net investments, or financial assets and equity investments in subsidiaries, increased by 11.3% to P7.47 trillion from P6.71 trillion a year ago. Cash and due from banks stood at P2.69 trillion as of end-May, up by 2% from P2.64 trillion a year earlier. Net real and other properties acquired increased by 7.2% to P108.19 billion from P100.93 billion a year ago. Banks’ other assets surged by 63.4% to P1.93 trillion from P1.18 trillion a year earlier. Meanwhile, the total liabilities of the banking system rose by 12.8% to P22.5 trillion from P19.95 trillion in the year-ago period. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said the higher asset level as of end-May showed the banking sector’s strong growth. “This is again more than twice faster than gross domestic product (GDP) growth, largely attributed to the sustained double-digit growth in the net income of banks, considered among the most profitable industries in the country,” he said in a Viber message. Earlier data from the central bank showed that the banking industry’s net income had risen by 2.95% to P92.107 billion as of end-March. This is also in line with faster loan growth in recent months, Mr. Ricafort said. Bank lending grew by 9.6% to P11.91 trillion as of end-April, latest data from the BSP showed. Mr. Ricafort also cited the continued recovery of the economy and business activities from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. He said possible policy rate cuts would “further boost trading gains and other investment income of banks” in the coming months. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. has said the central bank is on track to begin cutting rates by August, for a total of 50 basis points (bps) worth of cuts for 2024. The Monetary Board is set to hold its next policy review on Aug. 15. If the BSP begins policy easing in August, this would be the first rate cut in over three years or since the central bank last delivered a 25-bp cut in November 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Market players are also anticipating the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates as early as the third quarter. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell told lawmakers that “more good data” would build the case for rate cuts. The odds of a rate cut in September are about 75% and will get the next cue from data later in the day that were expected to show easing US inflation, Reuters reported.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/12/607648/phl-banks-total-assets-up-12-4-as-of-end-may/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'PHL likely to be ‘big winner’ once India eases rice export restrictions', 'author': [' Luisa Maria Jacinta C. Jocson'], 'date': 'July 12, 2024 | 12:34 am', 'article': ' THE PHILIPPINES is seen to benefit the most from an expected decline in global rice prices once India relaxes restrictions on rice exports, Nomura Global Markets Research said. “We expect the Philippines to be the biggest winner in Asia, given the high share of rice in its consumer price index (CPI) basket, its dependence on rice imports and recent rice import tariff reductions,” it said in a report. “The Philippines will likely benefit most from falling international rice prices, via positive terms-of-trade effects and easing domestic food price inflation.” Market participants are expecting India, the world’s largest exporter of white rice, to relax restrictions on rice exports soon. Last year, India suspended exports of non-basmati white rice amid concerns over domestic supply. “Since India accounted for 35% of global rice exports in 2022, making it the top rice exporter in the world, its export restrictions pushed up global rice prices and hurt rice importing nations globally,” Nomura said. “In our view, India is likely to gradually remove the restrictions on its rice exports in coming months,” it added. Nomura said it sees “brighter” prospects for the Philippines, which is highly dependent on imported rice. “Net rice imports accounted for 0.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, the highest in Asia. As such, lower global rice prices should have the most beneficial impact on the Philippines, followed by Indonesia,” it said. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects Philippine rice imports to hit 4.6 million metric tons (MMT) this year, higher than the Agriculture department’s 3.9 MMT projection. As of June 27, the Philippines had imported 2.31 MMT of rice, latest data from the Bureau of Plant Industry showed. “Without price controls or subsidies, the pass-through to domestic rice prices is also significant and swift, contributing to more downward pressures on headline inflation, which is already set to be impacted by the government’s announcement of a substantial rice import tariff reduction,” Nomura said. President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. last month signed Executive Order No. 62, which slashed tariffs on rice imports to 15% from 35%, until 2028. The measure is expected to bring down retail rice prices by P6 to P7 per kilo, the Agriculture department said earlier. Nomura noted the weight of rice in the Philippines’ CPI basket at 8.9%, which is “much higher” than its neighboring countries. In June, rice inflation eased to 22.5% from 23% a month ago. This marked the third straight month of slower rice inflation. Rice accounted for 45.2% of overall inflation, equivalent to 1.7 percentage points. “Easing inflation would further support our view that BSP will start its easing cycle by October, although the risk of an earlier first rate cut (i.e., in August) is rising, given recent comments by Governor Remolona that BSP does not have to wait for the Fed,” Nomura added. Roehlano M. Briones, a senior research fellow at the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, said rice prices could further decline if India eases its restrictions. “The rice tariff cut is expected to reduce the price by about P7. (Prices can go) lower if India lifts restrictions,” he said in a Viber message. Latest data from the Agriculture department showed that the average price of well-milled rice ranged from P48-55 per kilogram as of July 10, while regular milled rice was P45-52. “There could be a further decline in import prices, but exporters to the Philippines could also adjust their prices upwards knowing that we have reduced our tariffs,” Raul Q. Montemayor, national manager of the Federation of Free Farmers, said in a Viber message. “It remains to be seen whether rice retail prices will go down and benefit consumers,” he added. Mr. Montemayor said that based on his computations, the margin between import and retail prices shrink when import prices go up. “Once import prices go down coupled with the lowered tariff rate, market intermediaries might just recoup the margins they lost and not pass on any benefit to consumers.” —Luisa Maria Jacinta C.

Marcos,Jr. has appointed banker Walter C. Wassmer to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) rate-setting body, according to a Palace statement. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Wassmer was a consultant and nonexecutive director of Sy-led BDO Unibank, Inc., the country’s largest bank in terms of assets. The announcement comes weeks after the resignation of two Monetary Board (MB) members who were embroiled in a scandal involving “ghost employees.” A Bloomberg report earlier said Malacañang had accepted the resignation of MB members Anita Linda R. Aquino and V. Bruce J. Tolentino, effective June 30. When asked whether Mr. Marcos has found a replacement for the remaining MB vacancy, Presidential Communications Office Secretary Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said in a Viber message: “None for now.” Mr. Wassmer and the other appointee will complete the unexpired terms of Ms. Aquino and Mr. Tolentino or until July 2026. Mr. Wassmer is a seasoned banker, having held positions at BDO, Far East Bank and Trust Co. and Union Bank of the Philippines, Inc. (UnionBank).He was also a senior board adviser at Lopez-led First Philippine Holdings Corp. from November 2022. Mr. Wassmer was senior executive vice-president and head of institutional banking group at BDO from 1997 to 2022. He was chairman and officer-in-charge of BDO Elite Savings Bank, Inc. He was also senior vice-president of the Far East Bank from 1986 to 1997; assistant vice-president of UnionBank from 1983 to 1986; and corporate account officer of the Bancom Finance Corp. from 1980 to 1982. He has also held director positions in several companies, including BDO Finance Corp., MMPC Auto Financial Services Corp. and Mabuhay Vinyl Corp. Mr. Wassmer holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Commerce from De La Salle University. The Monetary Board exercises the powers and functions of the BSP including the conduct of monetary policy. It is composed of seven members including BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. The other MB members are Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto, former BSP Governor and Finance Secretary Benjamin E.

As of early July, we have 205 PPP projects, including those in local government units, under implementation and 143 projects in thepipeline,” NEDA Secretary Arsenio M.Balisacan was quoted as saying in a statement. Nine PPP projects amounting to P65 billion were added to the pipeline as of July. “We are also encouraged to note that more and more social infrastructure projects in health, water and sanitation, as well as solid waste management, are in the pipeline,” Mr. Balisacan added. The National Government leans on support from the private sector in shouldering its budgetary and infrastructure project implementation shortfalls. It has passed several policies over the past months that seek to create an enabling environment for infrastructure development. Republic Act No. 11966 or the PPP Code, which took effect in December last year, sought to increase private sector participation infinancing, operating, and maintaining infrastructure projects. Under the Marcos administration’s “Build Better More” program, the government has 185 infrastructureflagship projects (IFP) valued at P9.54 trillion in the pipeline. Mr. Balisacan also said that 63 IFPs, including the Pasig-Marikina River channel improvement project, Central Luzon Link Expressway, and the Panguil Bay Bridge project, are currently underway. The NEDA chief said 31 more IFPs have been approved for implementation, six are awaiting government approval, and 82 are in the preparation stage. The government’s move to allow full foreign ownership in renewable energy projects as well as public utilities like telecommunications, domestic shipping, railways, subways, airlines, expressways, tollways and airports, is expected to increase foreign investments in infrastructure, Mr. Balisacan said. To fast-track implementation of infrastructure projects, the NEDA chief said there is a need to streamline and enhance processes and speed up the acquisition of right of way. In April, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. also signed Executive Order (EO) No. 59 to fast-track the processing of permits for infrastructure flagship projects. “By expanding and upgrading our infrastructure, we aim to create enabling conditions for high-quality job creation for millions of Filipinos, raise the competitiveness of our local industries, diversify our growth drivers to strengthen economic resilience, and enhance regional connectivity by linking our leading and lagging regions,” Mr. Balisacan said. Terry L. Ridon, a public investment analyst and convenor of think tank InfraWatch PH, said the pace of implementation of IFPs would depend on government agencies. “With legislation and policy frameworks in place, faster infrastructure development will now be determined by capable leadership of infrastructure agencies,” he said in a Viber message. “This leadership has not been apparent in the Transportation department with only one concluded PPP (Ninoy Aquino International Airport rehabilitation) by the President’s State of the Nation Address (in July.) The public is still waiting for its urgent action on the EDSA (Epifanio de los Santos Avenue) busway and MRT-3 (Metro Rail Transit Line 3) PPPs.” In May, the PPP Center said that its evaluation of Megawide Construction Corp.’s unsolicited proposal for the EDSA busway system is nearing completion. The Department of Transportation also said it is reviewing the terms of reference for the auction of MRT-3’s operations and maintenance contract by thefirst quarter of 2025. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said the government has implemented several measures, including the establishment of “green lanes,” to attract more investors in the Philippines. As of June 20, around P2.32 trillion worth of projects, mostly in renewable energy, have been approved to go through the “green lane” system, the Board of Investments said earlier. The government, through EO No. 18, established the “green lane” in all government agencies to speed up the approval and registration process for priority or strategic investments. —B.M.D.Cruz', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/15/607979/143-ppp-projects-in-the-pipeline-neda/'}\n",

In June, the Monetary Board kept its benchmark rate unchanged for a sixth straight meeting at 6.5%, the highest in over 17 years. Nomura’s baseline forecast for the Philippines’ policy rate is at 5% at end-2025. However, its Modified Taylor Rule (MTR) estimates see the key rate slashed to as low as 4%. According to the report, the MTR estimates to “quantify where Asian policy rates ‘should be.’” Nomura’s baseline projection also anticipates the BSP to deliver a rate cut in October. It projects a total of 150 bps of cuts by the second quarter of 2025. “However, the MTR suggests this would leave policy rates in restrictive territory, given an imminent fall in inflation to below the midpoint of the 2-4% target range, partly aided by lower rice prices.” “The MTR suggests policy easing should begin in Q3 2024, with 250 bps of cumulative cuts to a terminal rate of 4% by Q2 2025,” it added. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. has said that the central bank is on track to begin policy easing by August. He said that the BSP could cut rates by up to 50 bps this year, with a 25-bp cut each in the third and fourth quarters. The Monetary Board has raised rates by a cumulative 450 basis points (bps) from May 2022 to October 2023. Nomura also noted the improved expectations of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates this year. “The global backdrop has also become more conducive, with US core (consumer price index) inflation softening in June and setting the stage for the Fed to cut policy rates twice this year, in September and December, consistent with our US economics team’s baseline views,” it said. US consumer prices fell for the first time in four years in June amid cheaper gasoline and moderating rents, firmly putting disinflation back on track and putting the Federal Reserve another step closer to cutting interest rates in September, Reuters reported. Financial markets saw a roughly 85% chance of a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, compared with about a 70% chance seen before the report. Two rate cuts are anticipated this year. Mr. Remolona earlier said that the BSP does not need to wait for the Fed before it begins cutting rates. He said that while the BSP monitors the Fed’s moves, it is not a “decisive factor” in its own monetary decisions. The Monetary Board’s (MB) next policy review is on Aug. 15.

Cruz'], 'date': 'July 15, 2024 | 12:33 am', 'article': 'THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT’S (NG)debt service bill jumped year on year in Maydue to a surge in interest payments, the Bureauof the Treasury (BTr) said. Data from the Treasury bureau showed that debt payments rose by 40.64% to P68.98 billion in May from P49.05 billion in the same month a year ago. Month on month, debt payments dropped by 57.34% from P161.7 billion in April. The debt service refers to payments made by the government on its domestic and foreign debt. The bulk (88.57%) of May’s debt service bill went to interest payments. Interest payments went up by 47.78% to P61.1 billion in May from P41.34 billion in the same month a year ago. Interest paid on domestic debt increased by 56% to P46.07 billion from P29.53 billion a year ago. Meanwhile, interest payments to foreign creditors grew by 27.18% to P15.03 billion in May from P11.82 billion a year ago. On the other hand, principal payments inched up by 2.34% to P7.88 billion from P7.7 billion last year. Month on month, amortization plunged by 92% from P94.2 billion in April. Broken down, amortization on domestic debt in May dropped by 96.8% to P85 million from P2.66 billion a year ago. Principal payments on external debt increased by 54.51% to P7.8 billion in May from P5.05 billion last year. FIVE MONTHSIn the first five months of the year, the NG’sdebt service bill increased by 48% to P1.22 trillion from P819.53 billion in the year-ago period. Amortization payments climbed by 51.73% to P895.13 billion in thefirst five months from P589.95 billion a year ago. Principal payments on domestic debt reached P754.86 billion, while those on external debt amounted to P140.27 billion. Meanwhile, interest payments in the January-to-May period jumped by 40.08% to P321.59 billion from P229.57 billion a year prior. Broken down, interest paid on domestic debt stood at P231.38 billion, while interest payments for external debt reached P90.21 billion. Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said the higher debt payments in May could be due to the elevated interest rates and weaker peso. “The higher debt servicing bill of the NG could be attributed to higher interest rates that increased borrowing costs/financing costs,” he said via Facebook Messenger. Mr. Ricafort said the weaker peso exchange rate increased the peso equivalent of external debt and debt servicing. The peso closed at P58.52 against the dollar as of end-May, depreciating by P0.94 from its P57.58finish as of end-April. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has kept the key policy rate at an over 17-year high of 6.5% since October 2023. The higher debt payments could also reflect the wider budget deficit, Mr. Ricafort said. The NG’s budget deficit in May widened 43.1% to P174.9 billion amid strong spending over revenues, BTr said. In thefirst five months of the year, the budget gap ballooned by 24.06% to P404.8 billion from P326.3 billion a year ago. “There could also be some payment of some multilateral foreign debts, as well as some maturity of some local government securities/debts,” Mr. Ricafort said. As of end-May, the NG’s debt hit a record high P15.35 trillion, with P10.44 trillion coming from domestic sources and P4.9 trillion from foreign sources. —Beatriz Marie D.

Tabile'], 'date': 'July 15, 2024 | 12:34 am', 'article': 'THE PHILIPPINE EconomicZone Authority (PEZA) approved P8.65 billion worth of projects in June, 73.4% lower than a year ago. In a statement over the weekend, the investment promotion agency said the PEZA Board approved 25 new and expansion projects at its June 28 meeting, up from 22 projects a year ago. These projects are expected to contribute $416 million in export value and 5,881 direct jobs. However, the amount of PEZA-approved investments in June was 73.4% lower than the P32.56 billion worth of investments approved in the same month last year. Of the 25 projects, 22 are from locator companies and three from economic zone (ecozone) developers, PEZA said. “These locator companies comprise 11 export manufacturing projects, followed by six projects in information technology and business process management (IT-BPM), three in domestic markets, one in facilities development, and one in logistics services,” it added. Calabarzon was still the top investment destination in June, accounting for 15 projects. The other investment destinations were the National Capital Region, Region III (Central Luzon), Region V (Bicol Region), Region VII (Central Visayas),and Region XII (Soccsksargen). LOWER INVESTMENTSFor thefirst half, PEZA said it approved P45.48 billion worth of investments, plunging by 43.6% from the P80.59 billion worth of investments approved in the same period last year. The PEZA approved 120 projects which are expected to create over 25,000 jobs and generate $1.61 billion in export value. “The new projects approved recorded an 18% increase from 102 to 120, with projected direct employment reaching a remarkable 64% uptick from 15,424 to 25,259 this year,” PEZA said. PEZA Director-General Tereso O. Panga said that the approval of the 120 projects signals confidence in the country’s business environment and economic potential. “Creating more jobs for Filipinos signifies the agency’s proactive efforts in positioning the Philippines as a premier investment destination in Asia,” he said. During the six-month period, PEZA said it approvedfive big-ticket projects worth P31.36 billion. In June, it approved two projects worth P6.15 billion. A Malaysian company will set up a manufacturing and assembly facility for hair stylers, while a Japanese company will manufacture biomass fuel products, oxygen reducers, and activated charcoal made from coconut shells in General Santos City. From January to June, the top investment sources were the Cayman Islands (P8.86 billion), Japan (P8.02 billion), Malaysia (P4.53 billion), Hong Kong (P1.62 billion), and Singapore (P1.27 billion). The electronic manufacturing services sector attracted the most investments, accounting for P19.77 billion. This was followed by the ecozone development (P16.21 billion), IT-BPM industry (P2.89 billion), and automotive (P1.04 billion). “Eastern European countries are also quite interested in the Philippines, with visits from Ukrainian, Polish, and Russian delegations conducting inquiries and site visits preparatory to investing in the country,” PEZA said. PEZA is hoping to approve between P200 billion and P250 billion worth of investments this year. If realized, this will be at least a 15% growth from the P175.71 billion worth of investments approved in 2023. —Justine Irish D.

      "{'title': 'PHL likely to grow by 5-6% this year — House think tank', 'author': ['Kenneth Christiane L. ', 'Basilio'], 'date': 'July 16, 2024 | 12:31 am', 'article': 'ByKenneth Christiane L.Basilio THE GOVERNMENT of PresidentFerdinand R. Marcos, Jr. mighthave done enough pump-priming and should let the private sector take on a bigger role in boosting the economy, according to a congressional think tank. “The resilience and ingenuity demonstrated by Filipinos, particularly in crises, should serve as a reminder that the government can trust the private sector to do its part in growing the economy. To realize this potential, policy makers must prioritize providing a favorable environment for businesses to thrive,” the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (CPBRD) said in a report on Monday. “This includes lowering regulatory burdens, improving infrastructure, investing in education and skills development in areas that offer the highest economic returns, and fostering competition,” it added. The Philippine economy would probably grow by 5.02% to 6.17% this year, compared with the government target of 6-7%, the CPBRD said, noting that heightened inflationary pressures, tightening fiscal constraints, weak capital formation and anemic growth in critical productive sectors could further hamper growth. The think tank said inflation is still a “large and growing threat to economic growth and stability.” “If prevailing inflationary pressure remains unabated, the likelihood of an economic slowdown is heightened,” it added. For the first six months of 2024, headline inflation averaged 3.5%, slightly higher than the central bank’s 3.3% full-year forecast. “Anticipated shifts in regional and global value chains, tightening fiscal constraints, growing geopolitical instability, and the Philippines’ vulnerability to climatic shocks (i.e., a single typhoon that hits Central Luzon has the outsized potential to severely aggravate existing agricultural productivity issues) are other potential threats on the horizon,” the think tank said. The CPBRD expects growth momentum to continue in the second and third quarters, before decelerating in the fourth quarter. In a low-growth trajectory, the think tank sees gross domestic product (GDP) expanding by 5.05% in the second quarter, 5.7% in the third quarter and 3.56% in the fourth quarter. “The low-growth trajectory can be viewed as the expected scenario if inflation accelerates and begins eroding productivity — sooner rather than later,” it said. On the other hand, the CPBRD’s high-growth scenario sees GDP expanding by 6.3% in the second quarter, 7.04% in the third quarter and 5.35% in the fourth quarter. “While the Philippine economy faces significant headwinds, it also has the potential for robust and inclusive growth. The path forward necessitates a balanced approach that addresses immediate challenges while laying the foundation for long-term sustainable development,” the CPBRD said. The think tank said a strong partnership between the government and the private sector can help the Philippines realize its full economic potential. The Philippine economy faces both challenges and opportunities in the current global economic landscape, it said. “Exploiting its strengths in services, manufacturing, and agriculture, the country can position itself as a competitive player in emerging regional markets — and eventually the global market,” it said. “This, however, requires a collaborative effort from both the public and private sectors to build robust markets, foster innovation, and leverage emerging technologies.” Meanwhile, Security Bank Corp. Chief Economist Robert Dan J. Roces said the government’s 6-7% GDP growth target is not out of reach despite elevated interest rates and high inflation. “Rising remittances and a potential infrastructure spending boost offer promising signs,” he said in a Viber message. “Streamlining regulations, investing in vital infrastructure, and nurturing a skilled workforce can unlock private sector potential beyond restrictive requirements,” Mr. Roces said adding that the Marcos administration’s focus on infrastructure and public-private partnerships is a step in the right direction. The government should also limit its intervention in the economy to allow the private sector to stimulate the local economy, Leonardo A. Lanzona, an economics professor at the Ateneo de Manila, said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “The economy is so dependent on government expenditures that any underspending causes a negative effect on growth,” he toldBusinessWorld. “With private consumption and investment declining, the government in turn has crowded out the private sector and hence not been able to meet its targets.” Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said Philippine GDP growth could normalize to around 5.5-6.5% annually in the coming years. In a Viber message, he said it would be possible for the Philippines to achieve 6% GDP growth in the following quarters due to the continued recovery of businesses and increases in government spending in preparation for the 2025 midterm elections.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/16/608151/phl-likely-to-grow-by-5-6-this-year-house-think-tank/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'NG’s use of GOCCs’ excess funds flagged', 'author': ['Kyle Aristophere T. Atienza, '], 'date': 'July 16, 2024 | 12:32 am', 'article': 'ByKyle Aristophere T. Atienza,Reporter BUDGET ANALYSTS on Mondayflagged the National Government (NG) for diverting excess funds from state-owned companies, noting that the move may compromise their services while the funds may likely be used by politicians as the 2025 polls near. The move is a populist approach to addressing the fiscal situation, with the government refusing to push for new taxes despite implementing new programs and projects, they added. However, the Department of Finance (DoF) in a statement defended the move, saying that tapping “unused and idle” funds of GOCCs is a “more prudent fiscal option than borrowing more or imposing taxes.” Data from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) showed that the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) in May remitted P20 billion and 30 billion, respectively, to the NG — thanks to an overlooked provision in the 2024 national budget law authorizing a cash sweep from government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs). Zy-za Nadine M. Suzara, a public budget analyst and former executive director of policy think tank Institute for Leadership, Empowerment, and Democracy, said the move should be a cause for public concern since it “compromises their ability” to deliver their mandated services. Initially, the Executive branch requested only P281.91 billion in unprogrammed funds in the then-proposed 2024 national budget. But in the 2024 General Appropriations Act (GAA) or thefinal version of the national budget that President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. signed in December 2023, unprogrammed funds ballooned to P731.45 billion, prompting several legislators tofile a case before the Supreme Court. The case is still ongoing. From the usual three sources of unprogrammed funds such as excess revenue collections, new revenues from tax or nontax sources, and approved loans for foreign-assisted projects, the 2024 GAA also included fund balance of GOCCs with consideration of their disbursement in previous years. “Those funds were appropriated for a reason. The solution to poor spending is not to keep taking out the funds but to improve the capacity of institutions to efficiently deliver their respective mandates,” Ms. Suzara said. She noted\\xa0tapping into\\xa0the funds of the GOCCs is very similar to what legislators initially wanted to do in the original version of the Maharlika Investment Fund, which received seed funding from the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines. “This is in fact worse than the earlier version of Maharlika because it gives blanket authority to the National Government to do a cash sweep of just about any GOCC that’s unable to disburse funds,” she explained “At least in Maharlika, theGOCCs were identified in the bill.” Ms. Suzara said if GOCCs continue to underspend, then it is very likely that they will remit more funds to the Treasury tofinance the long list of items under unprogrammed appropriations in the 2024 budget. “It is ironic that budget items in the unprogrammed appropriations appear to be more of a priority as election nears when in reality, the unprogrammed appropriations is supposed to be just a standby fund for things that aren’t funded in the programmed appropriations,” she added. “If this is left unchallenged, then we can expect this to continue as the national budget grows annually.” Economic managers are proposing a P6.352-trillion national budget for 2025, a 10% increase from this year’s P5.768-trillion budget. Cielo D. Magno, a professor at the University of the Philippines School of Economics who had served as Finance undersecretary under the Marcos Jr. administration, said what the Congress did at the bicameral conference for the 2024 national budget was “unconstitutional” because it was in effect “trying to amend existing laws and charters of GOCCs by inserting a provision in the GAA tofinance the unappropriated portion of the GAA.” “Congress expanded the budget significantly through the unappropriated portion and tried tofind the money tofinance it by getting the GOCCs’ reserved fund,” she said in an e-mail. “This happened during the bicameral meeting, not during the actual deliberation/consultation of the proposed 2024 budget.” The move shows the “opaqueness” of the budget process, the opportunities for abuse, and the lack of accountability, she noted. In line with this year’s GAA, the DoF last February issued Circular 003-2024 which set the guidelines for financing unprogrammed appropriations sourced from the fund balance of GOCCs. Citing the circular and the GAA, the DoF asked the PhilHealth to remit its unutilized funds worth P89.9 billion to the Treasury. The landmark Universal Health Care (UHC) Act mandates the state insurer to use its excess funds to boost the benefits of its members and reduce the amount of their annual contributions. “No portion of the reserve fund or income thereof shall accrue to the general fund of the national government or to any of its agencies or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations,” according to Section 11 of the UHC law. ‘DOES NOT AFFECT VIABILITY’The DoF defended the move to transfer funds from PhilHealth and PDIC to finance unprogrammed appropriations. “The move does not affect the viability of participating corporations. It does not impair their delivery of services,” it said. The DoF said PhilHealth and PDIC’s respective boards “approved” the return of excess and unused funds. “The result promotes the common good, based on the list of recipients identified in the national budget.” It also noted that in the case of PhilHealth, “unused government subsidies are not part of its reserve funds, nor income that is being restricted by the UHC Act to be used by the National Government as a general fund.” Former Department of Health advisor Antonio J. Leachon said in a statement that excess PhilHealth funds that will be returned to the unprogrammed fund of the national budget are revenues from taxes on tobacco, vapes, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages, “which are specifically earmarked for health programs.” “It is alarming that despite having excess funds, PhilHealth has yet to comply with the provisions in Section 11 of RA 11223,” he said. PhilHealth’s reserve fund hit P463.7 billion in 2023. Ms. Suzara said that in the case of PhilHealth, private hospitals as well as direct and indirect contributors are affected by the NG’s use of its excess funds. Most vulnerable are indirect contributors such as indigents, beneficiaries of the government’s conditional cash transfer program or the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, those sponsored by local governments and other Filipinos aged 21 years old and above without capacity to pay premiums, Ms. Magno noted. Ms. Magno said PhilHealth beneficiaries are supposed to be getting expanded services from the state insurer but it’s not happening “because instead of pressuring and reforming PhilHealth, we are defunding it.” Lawmakers who were able to insert their pet projects for funding under unprogrammed appropriations are the gainers, she added. Ms. Magno described the NG’s act of depriving GOCCs of their excess funds as “populist,” saying it has refused to look for other sources of revenues while “reducing the budget for important programs like PhilHealth.” “But [it has] continuously increased programs and projects that shouldn’t have been prioritized like the confidential and intelligence funds, and the insertions of congressmen and senators,” she said. “Misplaced priorities, definitely not for the benefit of the Filipino people.” Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto has reiterated there will be no new taxes under the Marcos administration. “It is difficult for civil society and the media to monitor how the National Government is using funds from the GOCCs because there is no real-time reporting of this,” Ms. Suzara said, adding that while the Department of Budget and Management and the Treasury bureau consistently upload reports, they only contain aggregatefigures. “How do we know where the funds are funneled? Which localities or districts benefit? What projects are funded?” she asked. “We will find out about these things only after the Commission on Audit does its audit.” She urged the Marcos administration to proactively report how the funds from GOCCs are used through a dashboard. Ms. Magno said she and her colleagues are planning to question the validity and constitutionality of the insertions in the GAA and the DoF Circular 003-2024. “We are going tofile a petition before the Supreme Court,” she said.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/16/608210/ngs-use-of-goccs-excess-funds-flagged/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Meralco rates up by P2 per kWh in July as power costs ‘normalize’', 'author': ['Sheldeen Joy Talavera, '], 'date': 'July 16, 2024 | 12:33 am', 'article': 'BySheldeen Joy Talavera,Reporter HOUSEHOLDS SERVED by Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) will face higher power bills this month as rates go up by more than P2 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) due to a normalization in power costs. In a statement on Monday, Meralco said the overall rate would increase by P2.1496 per kWh to P11.6012 per kWh in July from P9.4516 per kWh in June. The power distributor attributed this hefty increase to the higher generation charge “as power costs normalized following artificially low rates last month.” Households consuming 200 kWh will see their monthly bill go up by around P430. Meanwhile, households consuming 300 kWh, 400 kWh, and 500 kWh would see an increase in their monthly bills by P645, P860, and P1,075, respectively. Joe R. Zaldarriaga, Meralco’s vice-president and head of corporate communications, said at a briefing that the latest adjustment is “almost unchanged without the steep reduction last month.” “Our power rates returned to normal that is why from P9.45 (per kWh), we are now back to the P11 range, to be exact, P11.60 (per kWh),” he said. Driving this month’s increase was the generation charge, which climbed by P2.0021 per kWh as the charges from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) returned to the normal level and as Meralco started the collection of deferred costs. To recall, the June electricity rate was supposed to be higher than May but was reduced by P1.9623 per kWh after the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) ordered the staggered collection of charges related to WESM purchases over a four-month period to soften the impact of the high generation rates. Aside from the ERC’s order, Meralco also requested, along with Quezon Power (Philippines) Ltd., San Buenaventura Power Ltd. Co. (SBPL), and South Premiere Power Corp. (SPPC), to stagger the collection of around P500 million in May generation costs until September. “We had a disclaimer as early as last month that in the month of July, anticipate that the increase will be significant as electricity prices will return to its previous level plus the deferred cost will be charged,” Mr. Zaldarriaga said in mixed Filipino and English. For this month, WESM charges went up by P6.637 per kWh “as charges not only normalized but also reflected the recovery of a portion of deferred WESM costs from the May supply month.” Meralco said, however, the increase was mitigated by the reduction in spot market prices as average demand in the Luzon grid went down by about 900 megawatts. Charges from independent power producers (IPPs) rose by P0.4392 per kWh due to higher fuel costs and lower average plant dispatch. “Charges from power supply agreements (PSAs) also went up by P0.3530 per kWh, as charges normalized and included the recovery of deferred costs for SBPL and SPPC’s 2024 EPSA (emergency power supply agreement),” Meralco said. WESM, IPPs, and PSAs accounted for 34%, 28%, and 38% of the company’s total energy requirement for July. Meanwhile, the transmission charge dropped by P0.1550 per kWh “due to the absence of reserve market settlement charges that affected last month’s ancillary service charges.” In March, the ERC ordered the temporary suspension of the billing and settlement of amounts in the reserve market following the significant price increase reported for the month compared with February. Taxes and other charges went up by P0.3025 per kWh. “This month’s rates included an adjustment in generation, transmission, system loss, and lifeline subsidy charges, under the ERC rules governing automatic cost adjustments and true-up mechanism for pass-through charges,” Meralco said. Distribution charge has remained unchanged at P0.0360 per kWh since August 2022. Lawrence S. Fernandez, Meralco’s vice-president and head of utility economics, said that there is a possibility of lower rates in August as demand further declines. “We saw in the spot market that because the rainy season has started, demand also went down and the reserve levels in the spot market have improved, so the price in the spot market also went down. So hopefully, this will continue, and this is reflected in the August generation charge,” Mr. Fernandez said in mixed Filipino and English. Data from the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines showed that as of June 25, the initial average WESM price for the entire country went down by 25.2% to P6.15 per kWh. Meanwhile, Mr. Zaldarriaga said this month’s bills would be delayed as Meralco sought the guidance from the ERC on the implementation of July rate adjustment. “Rest assured that Meralco will adjust the due dates to give our customers enough time to settle their bills,” he said in a statement.

Month on month, remittances inched up by 0.8% from $2.56 billion in April. “The expansion in cash remittances in May 2024 was due to growth in receipts from both land- and sea-based workers,” the BSP said in a statement. Remittances from land-based workers jumped by 3.8% to $2.06 billion while money sent home by sea-based workers grew by 2.6% to $519.373 million. In the January-to-May period, cash remittances increased by 3% to $13.365 billion from $12.981 billion a year ago. This was also its fastest pace of annual growth in a year or since the 3.1% recorded in May 2023. “The growth in cash remittances from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore contributed mainly to the increase in remittances in January-May 2024,” the central bank said. In thefirstfive months, the United States accounted for 40.9% of total remittances. This was followed by Singapore (7.2%), Saudi Arabia (6.1%), Japan (5.1%), the United Kingdom (4.7%), the United Arab Emirates (4%), Canada (3.4%), Korea (2.8%), Qatar (2.8%) and Taiwan (2.7%). “This 3.6% increase (in May), reaching $2.58 billion, suggests a combination of positive factors. Economic growth in key remittance source countries like the US, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore might be putting more money in the pockets of OFWs,” Security Bank Corp. Chief Economist Robert Dan J. Roces said in a Viber message. Mr. Roces said that rising wages of OFWs could also be another factor behind faster remittance growth. “Finally, favorable exchange rates incentivize sending more money back as it translates to a bigger bump in Philippine pesos received,” he added. In May, the peso sank to the P58-per-dollar level for thefirst time since November 2022. “The continued growth nevertheless is still a good signal for the overall economy as an important growth driver, especially in terms of consumer spending, which accounts for about 74% of the Philippine economy,” Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message. Mr. Ricafort also noted there was a seasonal increase in remittances due to the summer holiday. Meanwhile, personal remittances rose by 3.7% to $2.88 billion during the month from $2.78 billion. This brought personal remittances at end-May to $14.89 billion, higher by 3% from $14.46 billion in the same period a year ago. “The increase in personal remittances in May 2024 was due to remittances from land-based workers with work contracts of one year or more and sea- and land-based workers with work contracts of less than one year,” the BSP added. For the coming months, Mr. Ricafort said he expects modest growth in remittances as OFW families “still need to cope up with relatively higher prices locally that would require the sending of more remittances.” For thefirst six months of the year, headline inflation averaged 3.5%. This was slightly higher than the central bank’s 3.3% full-year forecast. Mr. Ricafort also noted there is a seasonal increase in remittances during the July-August period due to the need to pay for school tuition payments. The central bank expects cash remittances to grow by 3% this year.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/16/608212/fastest-in-five-months-cash-remittances-jump-by-3-6-in-may-bsp/'}\n",

Tabile'], 'date': 'July 17, 2024 | 12:31 am', 'article': ' APPROVED investment pledges may hit P1.6 trillion this year, amid expectations of higher inflows of foreign direct investments (FDIs) and the pipeline of green lane-endorsed projects, aTrade official said. Board of Investments (BoI) Managing Head and Trade Undersecretary Ceferino S. Rodolfo said the positive outlook stems from the central bank’s hike in projected FDI net inflows this year. “(The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) increased its projection to $9.5 billion despite the drop in net FDI in April, and considering that the overall January-April number is still up and the pipeline of projects is still up, we are thinking of adjusting the upper limit to P1.6 trillion,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the Tatak Pinoy Act Forum on Monday. Latest BSP data showed FDI net inflows fell by an annual 36.9% to $556 million in April, the lowest level in 10 months. This brought FDI net inflows in the January-to-April period to $3.525 billion, up 18.7% from $2.971 billion a year ago. The BoI had previously set an internal target of approving P1.25 trillion to P1.5 trillion in investment pledges this year. The latest figures from the BoI showed that investment approvals reached P950 billion in thefirst six months, representing 59.4% of the agency’s P1.6-trillion target for the year. In 2023, the BoI approved P1.26 trillion worth of investment pledges. Mr. Rodolfo said the pipeline of projects under the green lane has also added to the optimistic outlook for higher investments this year. The government had established the green lane in all government agencies in order to speed up the approval and registration process for priority or strategic investments. As of June 20, P2.32 trillion worth of projects were endorsed to its One-Stop Action Center for Strategic Investments since it was established last year. “But the total projects that were registered out of that are only P1.31 trillion. So, in effect, we still have P1 trillion worth of projects that are not yet registered but are in the pipeline,” he added in mixed English and Filipino. The majority or 65 of the projects certified for the green lane system are renewable energy (RE) projects with a combined cost of P1.95 trillion. In its report, the BoI said that only 32 out of the 74 projects approved since last year are already registered with the BoI, with a total project cost of P1.31 trillion. The remaining 42 projects worth P1.02 trillion are still being eyed for registration. Mr. Rodolfo said that BoI will remain very aggressive in promoting and converting projects in the pipeline to actual registration. Last month, Trade Secretaryand BoI Chairman Alfredo E. Pascual said that 65 projects worth around $19 billion have been realized so far from the deals secured during President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.’s trips. Of the projects initiated, 12 are already operating and are registered with an investment promotion agency. These are valued at $328 million. Some 21 projects worth $1.6 billion have registered but are not yet operating, while 32 projects valued at $17 billion are in the process of registering. The initiated projects account for 30% of the $61.3 billion worth of investment leads gathered during the President’s trips, which covers 201 projects. —Justine Irish D.

Cruz,Reporter THE BUREAU of Internal Revenue(BIR) on Monday started collecting a withholding tax on online platforms and sellers. At the same time, the BIR extended the transition period for digital financial service providers by another 90 days to mid-October. BIR Commissioner Romeo D. Lumagui, Jr. said in a statement that electronic marketplace operators started imposing the withholding tax against sellers and merchants on July 15. “We have already extended this by 90 days. No further extensions will be given,” he said. A withholding tax is not a new form of tax, but an advance payment collected from the total income tax liability of an online seller. Under Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 16-2023, a withholding tax of 1% will be imposed on one-half of the gross remittances by e-marketplace operators and digital financial service providers to the sellers or merchants for the goods and services paid or sold through their platforms or facilities. In April, the BIR extended the transition period for another 90 days, or until July 14, in response to the request of the private sector. This regulation covers marketplaces for online shopping, food delivery platforms, platforms to book lodging accommodations, and other similar online service or product marketplaces. “The BIR aims to level the playing field between brick-and-mortar stores, which are regularly complying with their tax obligations, and online marketplaces,” Mr. Lumagui said. “Whether their business is operated online or through physical stores, sellers and merchants have to pay their taxes.” However, the BIR clarified that the tax will not be imposed if the annual total gross remittances to an online seller for the past taxable year has not exceeded P500,000; if the cumulative gross remittances to an online seller in a taxable year has not yet exceeded P500,000 or if the seller is duly exempt from or subject to a lower income tax rate pursuant to any existing law or treaty. Eleanor L. Roque, tax principal of P&A Grant Thornton, said the BIR’s move would help capture the appropriate taxes from the online marketplace. “If there is a discrepancy in the gross transactions and amount of withholding taxes, the online sellers will be asked to explain or reconcile the difference. This is the same process when the BIR audits any taxpayer,” she said in a Viber message. Meanwhile, the BIR issued a circular that extended the transition period for digital financial service providers to comply with the withholding tax by another 90 days or until Oct. 12. The transition period was supposed to have ended on July 14. BIR said the extension was meant “to provide additional time to the digital financial services providers to finally complete their respective system adjustments for compliance with the requirements of Revenue Regulations 16-2023.” The digital economy’s annual contribution to the country’s economic output fell as its growth slowed down in 2023. In 2023, the digital economy’s share to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) went down to 8.4% from 8.6% in 2022. This was its lowest share to GDP since 2018. In terms of gross value added, the digital sector grew by 7.7% to P2.05 trillion last year from the P1.9 trillion recorded in 2022. The country’s digital economy is projected to reach up to $150 billion by 2030, according to a 2023 report by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/17/608545/bir-collection-of-withholding-tax-from-online-sellers-starts/'}\n",

LUKE’S Medical Center (SLMC) announced on Monday an P18-billion investment in its Parañaque hospital, with groundbreaking scheduled for October. This expansion reinforces SLMC’s position as the Philippines’ premier destination for medical tourism, SLMC President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis P. Serrano said during a briefing. “The Parañaque facility is going to be a 450-bed hospital, as big and modern as the Global City unit, and the cost is P18 billion,” he added. He said that medical tourism will be a key component of SLMC’s third hospital, slated to commence operations in 2029. The Department of Tourism (DoT) has recognized SLMC as the country’s foremost facility for medical tourism. “Our revenue from foreign patients or international patients will come up around 7% to 10%, which translates into billions,” Mr. Serrano said referring to the gross revenue of its two hospitals in Quezon City and Global City. SLMC anticipates that revenue from international patients will constitute approximately 7% to 10% of its total gross revenue, translating to a figure in the billions, as noted by Mr. Serrano. This pertains to the aggregate revenue generated by SLMC’s two hospitals located in Quezon City and Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City. Tourism Secretary Maria Esperanza Christina G. Frasco said the government aims to position the Philippines as a leading health and wellness tourism destination in Asia and beyond. “We aim to secure our place in the global medical tourism market, which is currently valued at over $63.89 billion and expected to reach over $207 billion by 2030,” she said during an event on July 15. In 2023, the Tourism department recorded over 30,000 arrivals for medical tourism, contributing an estimated $15 billion to $25 billion in receipts.

Sy ', ' Reuters'], 'date': 'July 17, 2024 | 12:04 am', 'article': ' THE GOVERNMENT made a full award of the reissued Treasury bonds (T-bonds) on Tuesday at lower rates as the offer was met with robust demand amid expectations of monetary easing by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) raised P30 billion as planned via the reissued 10-year bonds it auctioned off on Tuesday as total bids reached P96.605 billion, or more than thrice the amount on the auction block. The bonds, which have a remaining life of nine years and six months, were awarded at an average rate of 6.212%. Accepted yields ranged from 6.18% to 6.223%. The average rate of the reissued seven-year bonds dropped by 54.2 basis points (bps) from the 6.754% fetched for the series’ last award on June 11 and was 3.8 bps lower than the 6.25% coupon for the issue. This was also 5.6 bps below the 6.268% quoted for the 10-year bond and 0.8 bp lower than the 6.220% seen for the same bond series at the secondary market before Tuesday’s auction, based on PHP Bloomberg Valuation Service Reference Rates data provided by the BTr. To accommodate the strong demand seen for Tuesday’s offer, the BTr opened its tap facility window to raise P20 billion more via the bonds at the same average rate. The government made a full award of the reissued 10-year debt as the offer fetched lower rates on strong demand amid “growing confidence that the BSP will cut sooner and by at least 50 bps total for the year,” a trader said via text message. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona,Jr. last month said the Monetary Board may deliver its first rate cut in over three years at its Aug. 15 review — the only policy meeting scheduled in the third quarter — as they expect inflation to continue easing this semester. The Monetary Board could reduce borrowing costs by 25 bps in the third quarter and by another 25 bps in the fourth quarter, he said. The BSP last month kept its policy rate at a 17-year high of 6.5% for a sixth straight meeting after raising interest rates by 450 bps from May 2022 to October 2023. The T-bonds on offer fetched lower yields following dovish signals from US Federal Reserve officials, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message. Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said on Monday the three US inflation readings over the second quarter of this year do “add somewhat to confidence” that the pace of price increases is returning to the Fed’s target in a sustainable fashion, remarks that suggest a turn to interest rate cuts may not be far off, Reuters reported. “In the second quarter, actually, we did make some more progress” on taming inflation, Mr. Powell said at an event at the Economic Club of Washington. “We’ve had three better readings, and if you average them, that’s a pretty good place.” “What we’ve said is that we didn’t think it would be appropriate to begin to loosen policy until we had greater confidence” that inflation was returning sustainably to 2%, Mr. Powell continued. “We’ve been waiting on that. And I would say that we didn’t gain any additional confidence in the first quarter, but the three readings in the second quarter, including the one from last week, do add somewhat to confidence.” Last week, the Labor department reported that its consumer price index fell in June from the month before, the first decline in four years. Economists now estimate the gauge the Fed uses for its inflation target, due out later this month, will show yearly price increases have eased closer toward 2%. The betting among investors has tilted strongly towards the Fed starting rate cuts in September. Changes to the policy statement in July could provide a strong signal of that by updating how inflation is described and assessing how recent data has added to policy makers’ confidence that the pandemic-era outbreak of inflation has subsided. After rapidly lifting interest rates starting in 2022 to combat the worst inflation outbreak since the 1980s, the Fed has left its benchmark policy rate unchanged since last July in a range of 5.25%-to-5.5%. As Mr. Powell spoke,financial markets all but abandoned what had been rising bets on a July rate cut. Traders continue to expect a September rate cut followed by additional cuts in November and December, bringing the policy rate down to 4.5%-4.75% by yearend. The BTr wants to raise P215 billion from the domestic market this month, or P100 billion from Treasury bills and P115 billion via T-bonds. The government borrows from local and foreign sources to help fund its budget deficit, which is capped at P1.48 trillion or 5.6% of gross domestic product for this year. —A.M.C.

The deal could be the largest maiden share sale in the Philippines since MREIT, Inc.’s P15-billion IPO in 2021, and could match the amount raised by another integrated casino-resort IPO more than a decade ago. Hann Resorts, led by Korean Dae Sik Han, has a target of listing on the Philippine bourse early next year, Alejandro H. Tengco, chairman of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp., told Reuters. “The growth story is they have a casino expansion including three championship golf courses and five-star hotels,” Mr. Tengco said.

Hann Resorts is weighing whether it can pursue an IPO this year, with fresh capital allotted for expanded gaming activities and the development of luxury estate Hann Reserve, a banking source with knowledge of the deal said on Tuesday. Hann Resorts’ Mr. Han did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news of the IPO was first reported by news site InsiderPH on Monday. Hann Resorts owns a casino-resort with 147 gaming tables, 868 slot machines, two VIP clubs, and two five-star hotels in a former US military air base in Pampanga province.

      "{'title': 'Oliver Jeffers makes climate picture books for adults and kids alike', 'author': ['Bloomberg'], 'date': 'July 17, 2024 | 12:04 am', 'article': 'AT HIS studio in Belfast, Oliver Jeffers sits in front of a poster of the moon’s phases. He leans forward to talk about his work, revealing more of the image behind him. In the center of the lunar chart, the Earth emerges from behind Mr. Jeffers’s head. We’re talking about the Earth in the wrong ways, Mr. Jeffers says. “It’s not true that the planet is broken. It is doing exactly what it should with the input it’s receiving,” he says. “It’s going to be around long after we’re gone. Life as we know it—that’s what’s in danger.” Jeffers is a visual artist, author, and climate activist whose oeuvre spans picture books, fine art, andlarge-scale installations. At COP26 in Glasgow, he installed two “siblings sculptures” of the Earth that he hoped would remind negotiators of the need for unified policies. In 2022, he crafted a six-mile recreation of the solar system in Northern Ireland, where he lives. And in 2017, fatherhood inspired Mr. Jeffers’s book,Here We Are, which explains the planet to kids. This week, Mr. Jeffers is presenting and performing a live reading at theBloomberg Green Festivalin Seattle, a gathering of artists, entrepreneurs and activists. There’s often a sense of scale and wonder in Jeffers’s work, a reflection of his view that emphasizing unity is more effective in the climate fight than leaning into blame. “My granny always said you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,” he says. “Humor can be incredibly disarming. I think it’s one of the most underutilized tools in the battle against indifference to climate change.” InHere We Are, for example, Jeffers drew on children’s hopeful feelings about the planet. “As I was walking around with a newborn baby, I was thinking… ‘Earth is beautiful and tremendous,’” he says. “And I thought other people would benefit from reminding themselves of these things they intuitively knew as children.” Mr. Jeffers argues that isolationism and nationalism make it easier for people to lose sight of the planet. In his COP26 sculpture, he inscribed all dry land with the phrase “People Live Here” and the oceans with “Nobody Lives Here,” a critique of the borders people use to divide themselves. When humans think about the planet in terms of large, abstract groups, it gives them permission to ignore climate change, Mr. Jeffers says. Mr. Jeffers has been surprised by the reach of some of his work. He first conceived ofBegin Again—a picture book that looks at human history from its beginnings to today—as geared at adult audiences, figuring it would go over children’s heads. But when he took the book on tour, he found it resonated with kids as well, and sparked meaningful dialogue between parents and their children. Those reactions are among his favorites, he says. Another reaction for the highlight reel: At COP26, Mr. Jeffers recalls a man approaching him to say that he had forgotten the Maldives in his sculpture of the Earth. They talked about how difficult it is to include every island nation, then the man introduced himself: “I’m the president there.” Mr. Jeffers handed him the paintbrush, and the president added the island himself.—Bloomberg', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/bloomberg/2024/07/17/608451/oliver-jeffers-makes-climate-picture-books-for-adults-and-kids-alike/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Decades after Billie Holiday’s death, ‘Strange Fruit’ is still a searing testament to injustice — and of faithful solidarity with suffering', 'author': None, 'date': 'July 17, 2024 | 12:05 am', 'article': 'SIXTY-FIVE years ago, on July 17, 1959, Billie Holiday died at Metropolitan Hospital in New York. The 44-year-old singer arrived after being turned away from a nearby charity hospital on evidence of drug use, then lay for hours on a stretcher in the hallway,unrecognized and unattended. Her estate amounted to70 cents in the bank and a roll of billsconcealed on her person, her share of the payment fora tabloid interviewshe gaveon her deathbed. Today, Holiday is revered as one of the most influential musical artists of all time.Timemagazine namedher 1939 recording of “Strange Fruit”the song of the 20thcentury. “In this sad, shadowy song about lynching in the South,”Timewrote in 1999, “history’s greatest jazz singer comes to terms with history itself.” Abel Meeropol, a New York City teacher and songwriter who used the pen name Lewis Allan, wrote “Strange Fruit” after seeing a photograph of a lynching thatshocked and haunted him: “Black body swinging in the Southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.” Holiday’s rendition of Meeropol’s song remains as stunning — and searing — today as when it was first recorded. “It hits, hard,” syndicated columnist Samuel Grafton wrote soon after the record’s release in 1939. “It is as if a game of let’s pretend had ended.” I’ma scholar of American religion,literature, andthe arts, and I’m interested in the ways that even powerfully secular works draw energy from religious narratives of justice, injustice, truth-telling and redemption. I find “Strange Fruit” a resonant example. (See the video of Billie Holiday singing “Strange Fruit” here:https://tinyurl.com/33cx7kf9.) UNFLINCHING LYRICSLike so many composers whose songs Holiday recorded —George and Ira Gershwin,Irving Berlin,Jerome Kern— Meeropol came from a family of Jewish immigrants to America who fled antisemitic violence in Europe. Two Great Migrations defined America in the early 1900s:rural South to industrial North, andOld World to New. Bothwere driven, in part, by the desire toleave racial terror behind. Together, these migrations enabled some of the most enduring musical collaborations of the 20thcentury. Thematically, the joint productions of Black and Jewish musical artists — Broadway productions ofShow BoatandPorgy and Bess, Holiday’s performances withBenny GoodmanandArtie Shaw— tended to sidestep the brute realities of prejudice, focusing instead on the luxury of ordinary happiness and unhappiness. “Strange Fruit” was different. The song gazes unflinchingly on the “strange fruit” of the title: hanged, burned, and mangled flesh left to rot on a tree. Well into the 20thcentury, white vigilante mobsmurdered thousands of Black Americans with impunity: lynching then leaving their bodies on display as a terrorist spectacle. Meeropolfirst jotted the song’s words and musicon the back of a cabaret program dated Nov. 13, 1938 — four days after Kristallnacht,the night of murderous anti-Jewish rampagesthroughout Nazi Germany that became a tipping point for the Holocaust. For Meeropol, a labor activist and a secular Jew,Black and Jewish Americans marched shoulder to shoulderin the cause of freedom from injustice. In another poem,he connected anti-Black violence with the persecutions of Jews: I am a Jew.How may I tell?The Negro lynchedReminds me wellI am a Jew. BLACK CHRISTAs Meeropol linked anti-Black and anti-Jewish prejudice, many Black Christians also connected their suffering with that of the Hebrew slaves in the Bible — and with Jesus’ own. According totheologian James Cone, “Black ministers preached about Jesus’ death more than any other theme because they saw in Jesus’ suffering and persecution a parallel to their own encounter with slavery, segregation,and the lynching tree.” In the decade Holiday recorded “Strange Fruit,” Harlem Renaissance writersW.E.B. Du Bois,Countee Cullen, andLangston Hughesall centered works around the figure of thecrucified Black Christ. Most African American Christiansbelong to Protestant churches, but Holiday did not. As a child she was baptized Catholic at a convent reform school,Baltimore’s House of the Good Shepherd for Colored Girls, where she was twice sent by the courts. She remained ambivalently Catholic for the whole of her life. THE FILLED CROSSProtestant churches commonly display the “empty” cross, showing the instrument of Jesus’ execution, but not his body. The message of the empty cross is resurrection and new life. According to the Christian story, Jesus was crucified, buried,and rose from the deadto redeem humankind from sin. In Catholic settings, one is more likely to find the “filled” cross: the body of Jesus with arms outstretched, hands and feet nailed to the wood. The crucifix emphasizes the agony of Jesus’ death and his solidarity with all who suffer. The filled cross also communicates the message that the crucifixion of Christ — God in human form — is not a once-and-for-all event. “When [Meeropol] showed me that poem,” Holiday said of “Strange Fruit,” “I dug it right off” because it “seemed to spell out all the things that had killed Pop.” Her father, jazz guitarist Clarence Holiday, died at 39 while touring in Texas. She believed he’d been refused lifesaving care because of his race. Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” evokes the filled cross in its testament to lynching as ongoing reality. “It still depresses me every time I sing it,” Holiday saidin her autobiography. “But I have to keep singing it … the things that killed him are still happening in the South.” Journalist Vernon Jarrettrecalled seeing Holiday perform in 1947. She was “singing this songas though this was for real, as though she had just witnessed a lynching,” Jarrett said of “Strange Fruit.” “There was a sense of resignation, as if ‘these people are going to have power for a long time and I can’t do a damn thing about it except put it in a song.‘” ONGOING TESTAMENTKeeping company with brokenness, rather than transcending or overcoming it, also describes Holiday’s way of relating to others in precarious circumstances. Her Harlem apartment,she said, was a “combination YMCA, boardinghouse for broke musicians, soup kitchen for anyone with a hard-luck story, community center, and after-hours joint.” A 1943 papal encyclical described the church itself similarly, asa place of shared pain, solace and sustenance. Anyone without money “could go there and eat,” poet and jazz vocalistBabs Gonzales recalled of Holiday’s place. “She fed everybody in New York for four years.” Holiday closed sets with “Strange Fruit” from 1939 until the final months of her life. In making it her trademark song, she offered solidarity and faithful witness to racial violence and injustice, not the remedy for these. But her testament carried extraordinary power. Shortly after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Bruce Springsteen, afellow Catholic with “misgivings,” madea playlist for America. First on his list was “Strange Fruit.” Asked whether he was optimistic about the future, Springsteen answered in the spirit of Holiday: witness, not triumph. “I don’t think anybody truly knows where we’re going from here,”he told writer David Brooks. But everyone “can see right now that the status quo is not okay. And that’s progress.”  Tracy Fessendenis a professor of Religious Studies at Arizona State University.

      "{'title': 'The many faces of Filipino contemporary art in 4 exhibits', 'author': ['“', 'Brontë H. Lacsamana'], 'date': 'July 17, 2024 | 12:06 am', 'article': 'DRAMATIC realist scenes depicting the concepts of honor, loyalty, and justice hang on light gray walls, near abstract, varied-texture representations of the complex human experience. Further into the gallery, the walls are adorned with unique portraits of people with their backs turned and intricate painted recreations of fabric. These are the works of painters Emman Cardeño, Archie Cayamanda, Dominique Alfonso, and Aubrey Caabay, who are holding simultaneous solo exhibitions at the Provenance Art Gallery. WEAVING THROUGH THE CROWDMs. Caabay has been exhibiting her works since 2012 in multiple galleries. Her works use fabric as a subject, the mix of textures and patterns a striking highlight of her paintings. With the use of resin, she sometimes incorporates real fabric in her works. Her latest mini solo show, “Weaving Through,” is an example of this. The layers of fabric and flowers that she paints convey movement that catches the eye, tempting viewers to step closer to inspect the remarkable detail. Meanwhile, the works of Mr. Cardeño in “Yesterday’s Mirage” stand out in their own way, boasting a complex composition of people in stern, texturized environments to represent narratives of personal and national identity. The artist, the youngest of the group at only 27 years of age, was discovered by the gallery online. His career in art began after graduating with an engineering degree, he toldBusinessWorldat the exhibit’s July 13 opening. “I’m still developing my conceptualization skills.Ang una muna aynarrative, composition,tapos pinupuno ko bago bawasan ang mga hindi kailangan(I first think about the narrative and the composition, then I fill up the whole work before I remove the unnecessary elements),” he said of his process. “Bago ako nakagawa nito, iyong nagturo sakin magpintaYouTube (Before I reached this level, my teacher was YouTube),” he added. For Raul Francisco, the gallery’s owner, it’s important to nurture self-taught artists like Mr. Cardeño who are passionate and committed to the craft, to help them distinguish themselves from the crowd of other artists. “You need to sort of cultivate it. We only suggest things and provide some creative supervision, but the rest is them, their form of art,” he said. A GLIMPSE OF PHILIPPINE ARTMr. Alfonso has been cultivating his art for a long time, his impressionist portraits conveying a certain edge as well as elegance. “Glimpse,” like his previous exhibitions, turns our attention to people’s backs. Viewers are left to ponder the unseen faces, thoughts, and motivations of those whose portraits he has painted, the brushstrokes capturing something hidden. In “Altered” by Mr. Cayamanda, there is a similar obscuring of the human soul, this time through abstraction. His paintings contain different portions, some of closeups of the human body contorted into dramatic shapes, some transposed with textured items like a smooth cloth or sharp-angled surfaces. “The fabric represents the spirit while the geometric surfaces represent the solid matter. Of course, the human figure represents the human,” explained Mr. Cayamanda. “I aim for each piece to fulfill different aspects of a person.” He added that artists naturally evolve, making him proud of his current works. “Hindi kami nananatili sa iisang sulok. Nagbabago din base saexperience,sa pinagdadaanan(We never stay in one corner. Our styles change based on experience, based on what we go through).” As an owner of an upscale gallery, Mr. Francisco explained that curating works for a certain demographic doesn’t mean less variety, with the four artists and their mini solo shows as proof that the art scene is ever-changing. “We’re all somewhat global citizens. We may not travel, but we’re fully aware of what’s going on in the world through social media, and that influences their work. Filipino contemporary art is amazing because we have such an interesting history — colonization, Catholicism, regional diversity,” he said. “It’s a breeding ground for creativity.” “Weaving Through,” “Yesterday’s Mirage,” “Glimpse,” and “Altered” are on view throughout July at Provenance Art Gallery, on the 2ndfloor of Shangri-La the Fort, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. —Brontë H.

(Meralco) on Tuesday said there may be a delay in its timeline to deploy micro-modular nuclear power plants by 2028 due to some challenges. “We thought we could be operational by 2028, within the (current) administration, but looking at it, it might be a bit challenging for the commercial deployment of SMRs (small modular reactors) or MMRs (micro-modular reactors) at that time,” Meralco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Manuel V. Pangilinan toldBusinessWorldon Tuesday. Despite these hurdles, the company still hopes to achieve its goal of having an operational prototype or demonstration plant by 2028, he added. In May, Meralco said that it was about to complete its feasibility study with US-based Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp. “We have finished the pre-feasibility with Ultra\\u200aSafe. We’ve commissioned them maybe about two or three months ago to do the full-blown feasibility. So, we probably should wait another month or so before they complete it,” Mr. Pangilinan said. In November last year, Meralco and Ultra Safe signed a deal to study the potential deployment of one or more micro-modular reactor energy systems in the country. An MMR unit or “nuclear battery” can “safely and reliably” provide up to 45 megawatts (MW) of high-quality heat, delivered into a centralized heat storage unit, according to Meralco. “One or more MMR nuclear batteries combine their heat in the heat storage unit, from where electric power or superheated steam can be extracted through conventional means to meet a wide range of power requirements, from tens to hundreds of MW,” the power distributor said. The nuclear initiative is part of Meralco’s commitment to adopting next-generation clean technologies. It is also in line with the goal of the Department of Energy of incorporating at least 1,200MWof nuclear energy in the energy mix by 2032. Earlier this month, Meralco introduced the pilot batch of scholars under its Filipino Scholars and Interns on Nuclear Engineering (FISSION) program that was launched last year. Upon completion of the academic program, the FISSION scholars will be sent to nuclear technology companies for their internship. Once they return to the Philippines in 2028, they will be reintegrated into Meralco and assigned to take on a role in its nuclear power generation unit.

Ochave,Reporter NEXGEN Energy Corp., a newly listed renewable energy (RE) company, saw its stocks rise by 1.79% or three centavos to P1.71 per share following its market debut on Tuesday, exceeding its initial price of P1.68 each. NexGen Energy listed its initial public offering (IPO) on the Philippine Stock Exchange’s (PSE) Small, Medium, and Emerging (SME) Board, becoming the third company to go public this year, alongside OceanaGold Philippines, Inc. and Citicore Renewable Energy Corp. Shares of NexGen Energy reached a high of P1.84 before settling at P1.71 by the end of its first trading day. The IPO listing of NexGen Energy brings the PSE closer to its target of achieving six public listings this year. NexGen Energy successfully raised P504 million in gross proceeds from the IPO of its primary common shares, earmarked for the construction and development of solar projects in Zambales and wind projects in Cavite. The company also plans to allocate a portion of the proceeds for further development and acquisition of RE projects. NexGen Energy sold 300 million primary common shares and an additional 15 million shares from its overallotment option, both priced at P1.68 apiece. The proceeds from the overallotment option were sold by Pure Energy Holdings Corp., NexGen Energy’s principal shareholder and parent company. During the listing ceremony, PSE President and CEO Ramon S. Monzon urged companies to proceed with their IPO plans to stimulate market activity. “I am often asked these days if companies with IPO plans are correct in waiting for better market conditions. My answer has consistently been that if your company has a good story and it needs capital to pursue its development or expansion plans, then that is the appropriate time to list your company,” Mr. Monzon said. “The more companies that defer their IPO plans because of what they call poor market conditions, the more these poor market conditions become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he added. Mr. Monzon also said that NexGen Energy is the first RE company to list on the PSE’s SME board. “This IPO serves as a timely reminder to other small companies that need to raise capital that the SME board is a very practical and feasible listing route,” he said. NexGen Energy President and Chief Executive Officer Eric Peter Y. Roxas said in his speech that the IPO proceeds will help the company’s expansion plans. “Although our IPO is a small issue, the funds raised will jump-start a basket of projects with our target of developing over 1,600 megawatts (MW) composed of several solar energy service contracts and 12 wind energy service contracts,” Mr. Roxas said. “The synergy we have with our sister company, Repower Energy Development Corp. (REDC), will play an important factor in the completion of these projects,” he added. Sought for comment, China Bank Capital Corp. Managing Director Juan Paolo E. Colet said in a Viber message that NexGen Energy’s public listing will encourage other RE or similarly sized companies to explore listing on the PSE. “This comes on the back of an improving market backdrop, with the PSE benchmark index rising more than 8% since hitting its year-to-date low last June,” he said. “We are pleased that the stock closed above its IPO price on its market debut. It appears that many short-term traders exited on the first day, but the bulk of NexGen Energy’s investors are strong hands who are confident about the company’s prospects,” he added. Globalinks Securities and Stocks, Inc. Trader Mark V. Santarina said that NexGen Energy’s stock price is poised to benefit from improving economic conditions and the government’s RE push. “The stock closed at P1.71, reflecting positive investor sentiment. RE companies are poised to benefit from the Philippine government’s target to increase the renewable energy share in the country’s energy mix,” Mr. Santarina said in a Viber message. “NexGen Energy shares could benefit from improved economic conditions, especially if the Federal Reserve cuts rates by September,” he added. Regina Capital Development Corp. Head of Sales Luis A. Limlingan said in a separate Viber message: “At this stage, there’s not enough technical analysis indicators, but hopefully it follows the market’s recent upswing.” NexGen Energy operates through its subsidiaries SPARC-Solar Powered Agri-rural Communities Corp., 5hour Peak Energy Corp., and Airstream Renewables Corp., which currently produce 13.86 MW of capacity. IPO proceeds aim to increase the company’s total capacity to 38.86 MW by the end of 2026.', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/corporate/2024/07/17/608494/nexgen-energy-stock-price-climbs-1-8-following-market-debut/'}\n",

In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF maintained its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for the Philippines at 6% this year and 6.2% in 2025. If realized, the Philippine economic growth would be the second fastest among selected Asian economies, after India’s 7.5% GDP growth forecast.  The Philippines’ growth forecast for 2024 is faster than China (5%), Indonesia (5%), Malaysia (4.4%), Kazakhstan (3.5%), and Iran (3.3%), the IMF said. It would also surpass Thailand (2.9%), Egypt (2.7%), Korea (2.5%), Pakistan (2%), Saudi Arabia (1.7%), and Japan (0.7%). “Asia’s emerging market economies remain the main engine for the global economy,” Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, economic counsellor and the director of research of the IMF, said in a statement. The IMF maintained its global growth projection at 3.2% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2025, “broadly unchanged” from the previous report’s forecasts. The IMF cut the United States growth forecast to 2.6% this year, but kept the growth estimate at 1.9% for 2025. “The forecast for growth in emerging market and developing economies is revised upward; the projected increase is powered by stronger activity in Asia, particularly China and India,” it said. The IMF raised its forecasts for emerging market and developing Asia, which is seen to grow by 5.4% this year and by 5.1% in 2025. The growth projection for China was also raised to 5% for this year, “primarily on account of a rebound in private consumption and strong exports in the first quarter.” China’s growth is expected to slow to 4.5% next year, and “to continue to decelerate over the medium term to 3.3% by 2029, because of headwinds from aging and slowing productivity growth.” However, “prospects for the next five years remain weak, largely because of waning momentum in emerging Asia,” IMF said. The IMF said risks to the outlook “remain balanced” although upside risks to inflation “stem from a lack of progress on services disinflation and price pressures emanating from renewed trade or geopolitical tensions.” “The risk of elevated inflation has raised the prospects of higher-for-even-longer interest rates, which in turn increases external, fiscal, and financial risks,” it said. “Prolonged dollar appreciation arising from rate disparities could disrupt capital flows and impede planned monetary policy easing, which could adversely impact growth. Persistently high interest rates could raise borrowing costs further and affect financial stability if fiscal improvements do not offset higher real rates amid lower potential growth.” During its last policy meeting, the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 5.25%-to-5.5%. Fresh projections from policy makers showed them dialing back expectations for rate cuts this year from three to just one, Reuters reported. —BMDC', 'link': 'https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/17/608546/philippines-likely-to-post-one-of-the-fastest-growth-rates-in-asia-this-year-2025-imf/'}\n",

Cruz'], 'date': 'July 17, 2024 | 12:34 am', 'article': 'THE ASEAN+3 MacroeconomicResearch Office (AMRO) trimmed its Philippine economic growth forecast for this year and in 2025, amid slowing external demand. In its latest update, AMRO sees Philippine gross domestic product (GDP) expanding by 6.1% this year, slightly lower than the 6.3% in the April report. Despite the downgrade, this is still faster than the 5.5% GDP growth in 2023, and within the government’s 6-7% target for this year.  “We have shaved down the growth for not just the Philippines but many of the countries in the region. The recovery in the external sector was weaker than expected,” AMRO Chief Economist Hoe Ee Khor said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday. “We may revise (the forecast) upward in the second half if the data shows that the economy (grows) more strongly,” Mr. Khor said. AMRO also downgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 6.3% from 6.5% in the previous report. This is within the government’s 6.5-7.5% goal for next year. Mr. Khor said Philippine growth has been weakened by gaps in infrastructure. “I think the government is very conscious of that and is trying tofill the gap. Unfortunately,fiscal space has been used up to some extent during the pandemic,” he said. The Philippine government aims to spend P1.47 trillion on infrastructure this year. The Marcos administration has committed to maintaining high investments in infrastructure or around 5-6% of GDP from 2024 to 2025. To complement domestic savings, the Philippines still has “a moderate business space” to attract more foreign investments. However, its economy remains one of the most restrictive in the region, Mr. Khor said. “We think the policy measures by the government will continue to attract more investment, and also with the improvement in infrastructure gap, will help to lift the (Philippines’) growth potential,” he said. Also, AMRO lowered its inflation forecast for the Philippines to 3.3% for this year from 3.6% in the April report. It raised its inflation projection to 3.1% for 2025 from 2.9% previously. AMRO said the BSP may maintain a tight monetary policy until a downward trend in inflation is sustained. Despite this, the Philippines is still projected to be the second-fastest growing economy among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members this year, behind only Vietnam (6.3%). Philippine growth is expected to be ahead of Cambodia (5.6%), Indonesia (5.2%), Malaysia (4.7%), Laos (4.5%), Brunei (4%), Thailand (2.7%), Singapore (2.4%), and Myanmar (1.8%). AMRO sees the ASEAN+3 region, which includes China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea, expanding by 4.4% this year and 4.3% in 2025. The ASEAN region is projected to grow by 4.8% this year and next year. “External trade is set to return to positive territory this year, which will supplement strong domestic consumption and the continuing recovery in tourism,” AMRO said in the report. AMRO said the global economy is expected to continue stabilizing next year, and monetary easing is seen to resume in major economies. The think tank lowered its inflation forecast for ASEAN+3 (excluding Laos and Myanmar) to 2.1% for this year from 2.5% previously “due to softer-than-expected food prices in several economies and lower imported inflation.” “Higher cost pressures could emerge in 2025 as economic momentum gains traction, but these are unlikely to trigger a large spike in ASEAN+3 inflation under the baseline scenario,” it said. AMRO said the overall balance of risks to the outlook has improved since April, but several risks such as a spike in commodity and shipping prices and tighter-than-expected US monetary policy. Other risks include a sharp slowdown in the US and Europe, weaker growth in China, and possible adverse spillovers from the US presidential election. “The bad news is that the region’s outlook next year could be significantly affected by the outcome of the US elections. The good news is, the region has weathered similar shocks before,” Mr. Khor said. The US presidential elections will be held on Nov. 5. Also, AMRO said geopolitical tensions are becoming “more pertinent” for ASEAN+3 economies. “The threat of geoeconomic fragmentation continues to rear its head as more economies announce trade controls or protectionist measures, following recent US tariff action against China. The ongoing shifts in global trade — including longer supply chains — can exacerbate the negative impact of these trade frictions, especially for ASEAN+3 economies, which are highly integrated in global trade,” AMRO said. —Beatriz Marie D.
